Being able to directly process a few individual clumps of generic sediments and rocks into several cubic meters of ore is wacky. 
As Neeyo pointed out, there should be more upkeep/cost to generate minerals. 
One such way would be to demand fracking solutions or similar corrosive chemicals to be consumed by the drill, possibly alongside with drill pipes (akin to native GTCEu‘s Large Drill). 

My personal bias leads me to requiring elaborate processing chains as seen in [[Beneficiation]] and such processes (Comminution, leaching, etc.)

Additionally, the yield of infinite ores should be lousy at best. Implemented like the sifter, where each individual ore block has a x% chance to be produced. #TODO, adjust this based on versatility.
