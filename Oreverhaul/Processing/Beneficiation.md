Beneficiation, also referred to as comminution, is the combination of processes applied to [[Types of Nodes and Deposits|ores and minerals]] [[Extraction|extracted]] from the surface and underground.
Beneficiation aims to separate the desired compound(s), metal or element from its host mineral, which is referred to as gangue (in solid form) or tailings (if it is a liquid/slurry).
These processes, aside from separation, also cover concentration, which primarily applies to metallic ores to enhance yield during smelting.

For a visual representation, refer to any of the following: [[Generalised Ore to Pure Metal.canvas|Ore to Pure Metal]], [[Yearning for the Mining.canvas|Yearning for the Mining]] and [[Three-Stage Comminution.canvas|Three-Stage Comminution]]. 
The gangue is treated as waste, but always finds applications elsewhere. The industry does not waste. 
Separation occurs through several processes, typically sorted into mechanical, chemical and electrochemical refining. In specialised cases, biological actors (bacteria) are employed.
