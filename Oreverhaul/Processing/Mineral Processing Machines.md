This page intends to include a mostly complete index and list of machines used for [[Beneficiation]].

I primarily (if not exclusively) want to focus on multiblocks for their perceived modularity and less bloat of single blocks for every tier. 

## Refining and Processing
### Comminution
Mechanical Refining refers to the processing of reducing the size of ore; synonymous to comminution which means 'To reduce to minute particles, pulverize'[^dictionary]
Technically speaking, the process of mining could be considered as mechanical refining as well, since those operations break down deposits and sediments, often several kilometres in size, into boulders and rocks that can be shipped. 
Crushing and milling are dry operations (i.e. with minimal liquid involved) whereas grinding is exclusively performed as wet operation or even as slurry or suspension.
