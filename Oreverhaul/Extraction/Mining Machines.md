## Generalised Excavation
### Targeted Local Outcrop Miner
Akin to what SuSy has at the present point, but possibly with tiers (motor, drill head, maybe in-situ crushing) and more costly in operation
	- A steady supply of mining fluid and lubricant have to be supplied (and maybe drill heads if using a cheap material that wears out easily)
- This shall produce *R o c k*, perpetually 
	- Rock with a mediocre content of usable ore, approximately 20-33%. 
### Large Mining Rig
Based off the base GT mining rig but available earlier on for carving out deposits at a slow, steady rate but still depleting the deposits in-world
- This one makes ready-to-use ores, but finitely. 
- Probably needs some advanced `mechanism` to justify horizontal excavation from a vertical pipe. 
### Bucket Wheel Excavator
Rather expensive, both in initial cost and upkeep. 
	(it's sheer power cost alone justifies internal combustion engines). 
	Tremendous, perhaps ranging around 17x33m footprint.  
Only works in a established open pit mine and in softer sediments or ores which have been blasted or otherwise loosened.  
Perhaps operates between a "In-World" mode and a "Imaginary" mode.
- In-World mode yields are directly tied to the deposit it is on, and the amount of blasting this deposit has undergone.
- Imaginary mode works off invisible deposits, which are horrid in quality but near-infinite in quantity, thus allowing stationary and complex facilities for extraction.
