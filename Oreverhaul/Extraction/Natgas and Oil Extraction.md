Oil/Gas Wells experience three phases in their life, each of which tied to the remaining petroleum in the deposit. 
- Primary Recovery
	When a field of gas or oil is first tapped, the pressure present in and on the pockets oftentimes suffices to bring the desired liquids to the surface, therefore not necessarily requiring machinery to extract it. However, machines may enhance the recovery rate. 
- Secondary Recovery
	Throughout the industrial exploitation of a deposit, the pressure drops to a point where the natural pressure does no longer suffice to raise the oil/gas to the surface, which now requires machinery to pressurise and or apply suction to the well to draw oil/gas from it. 
- Tertiary Recovery 
	Further injecting fluids or gasses like carbon dioxide or steam can help reduce the viscosity of the oil, which allows (relative) easier extraction. Usually the steam used is supplied by a dedicated combined cycle/co-generation power plant. 
Hydraulic Fracking is a different process; as it revolves around fracturing a oil- or gas-bearing mineral or sediment, which is an entirely different story compared to a deposit of crude oil and related.
	However, fracking can be applied to stimulate a oil or gas well, presumably within the terms of tertiary recovery or tertiary secondary recovery, after much of the field has been exhausted.
