Coal: Switched to Coal Blocks. Yes, IRL coal mining gets you big chunks of coal

Primitive Smelting: Only allows 1-metal ores to be smelted with only charcoal, which excludes ores like Chalcopyrite, Bornite or Tetrahedrite 
For Chalcopyrite, Bornite, silica is needed to extract iron metasilicate (FeSiO3) to get pure copper

LV-MV smelting recipes should be processing using EBFs

HV ore processing should utilize froth flotation
