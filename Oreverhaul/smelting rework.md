Coal: Switched to Coal Blocks. Yes, IRL coal mining gets you big chunks of coal

Primitive Smelting: Only allows 1-metal ores to be smelted with only charcoal, which excludes ores like Chalcopyrite, Bornite or Tetrahedrite 
For Chalcopyrite, Bornite, silica is needed to extract iron metasilicate (FeSiO3) to get pure copper

LV-MV smelting recipes should be processing using EBFs

HV ore processing should utilize froth flotation



part 2: total rework

smelteries now produce molten metal that needed to be cooled into ingots or to be processed directly into products such as plates, rods, wires

casting channels are needed to be implemented. Materials could be metal, sand, hardened clay. Channel should be open on the top, fluids inside the channel should render on the channels, and fluids can only travel on the same height level or travel down.

Continous casting should be availible in late MV or HV
