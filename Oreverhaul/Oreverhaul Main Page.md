# Regarding Benefaction and Dressing
The desired metal of an ore is typically enclosed in a crystalline structure and encased by huge volumes of, for this case, uninteresting rock, hereby called gangue (also known as deaf rock).
All rocks and minerals have naturally occurring fissures (faults) in their structure, which is exploited in mechanical refining. 
~~Most of this is transcribed from wiki please don’t yell at me~~ :frowning2:
## Mechanical Refining
Mechanical refining refers to all processes that reduce the size of ore and gangue particles and their sorting. 
The first step is typically done at the mine directly, by crushing the rock and minerals down to a size that fits onto vehicles. 
Primary crushing cover Jaw and Cone Crushers.
    - Jaw Crusher acts by repeatedly compressing the rock through an oscillating plate against a static plate. This results in size reduction from about 1m3 (1 block) to 20cm3 (new unit needed). 
- Cone crushing operates through a static reinforced cone, around which a mantle is placed. The mantle is exposed to heavy vibration, which compresses and repeatedly crushes the rock, as the grain size reduces further down the cone. (I’ll spitball 30cm3 to 1cm3).
Secondary crushing aims to reduce the grain size into a fine powder, usually for hydrorefining.
