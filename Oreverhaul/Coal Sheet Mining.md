Coal is a sedimentary-type deposit, and the Team agreed to modify coal type generation (Anthracite, Tar Coal, Lignite, etc.) to occur in a similar manner to bauxite, as to say, as near-solid formation. 
Machinery to dig out these sheets and backfill/collapse the cavity is commonly employed as these sheets may be several kilometers across and long.
