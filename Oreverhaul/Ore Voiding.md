RE: [[Disposal]]
As the [[Processing of Deposit Rocks]] produces a ridiculous quantity of ores, most of which are little-used, a long-wound debate sparked on how to handle these amounts of [[Gangue]], for which Gruberu implemented an [[Incinerator]]. However, consensus was established that incinerating ore was considered ridiculous. 
Thus, Darkakken suggested a recipe for turning ore blocks into slurry using water in a mixer. 
Divine Ray (the editor) wishes to remark that this recipe should only operate for processed/crushed/dust ore. 
They also wish to propose an auxiliary voiding chain specifically for ores which should yield some generic mineral scraps and sediments as reward for a more elaborate chain.
