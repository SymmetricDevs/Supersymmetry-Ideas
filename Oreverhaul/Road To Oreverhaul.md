First, something that i could possibly do with help, is create an auto-generator for the intermediates of crushed ores based on sizing (gravel/sand/dust/powder). 
Each decrease of grain size comes with a higher power cost per unit and concentrates the desired mineral further. 
In other words: Smaller grain = more EU/t
and the following mock formula:
N unit mineral input -> `N*-X` granular material, `X*N` gangue (assuming integrated separation), where X is the material loss rate

The various grain sizes are all compatible for smelting/extraction, with increasing efficiency and reduced slag/waste as it progresses.

[[Slag]] is, for the metallurgical processes, poison, but useful elsewhere. 

For a publicly inaccessible build iâ€™ll tolerate SB machines as mockup for their respective multis (once we get the parametrised and whatever stuff for them)
