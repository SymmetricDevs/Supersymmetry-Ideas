## About Ore Deposits
Ores as such should still continue to exist, albeit not in the very regular and easy to exploit grid pattern of GT5 (if possible), but perhaps lean onto GT6 where ore deposits are equal to the stone they spawn in, so having a continuous and huge deposit per formation. 
if it is possible, i’d imagine having a motherlode to such a deposit where the ore quality or usable metal per arbitrary volume is extraordinarily high^[depending on the mineral, up to 70% metal], through which it diminishes further out in the edge of the deposit. This as well would provide a fair amount of usable ore from an early game <sub></sub>standpoint, but also last a long time once it becomes viable to extract and refine the poorer quality mineral using progressively advanced machinery and chemistry. 

The above is highly generalised, and exceptions will be made, to accommodate the nature of certain minerals and ores (because it seems unreasonable to have a displaced patch of igneous minerals in the middle of the ocean). 

Due to the non-feasibility of a tectonic simulation and similar operations ‘accurately’ place deposits we can only assume a placement depending on the biome and it's humidity and temperature traits to feed a biased distribution. this bias is set into place to allow the generation of sparse, poor yield deposits that prevent the scenario present in TFC where some crucial deposits are several kilometres away, which have to be travelled on foot. Avoid. 
The only argument for such spacious distribution of ores would be that it heavily incentivises the use of train networking.
