# [[Superalloys]]:
LRDMTNS can just tweak the recipes of some of the GCYM alloys to make them more realistic:
[Powder Metallurgy Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgukjCT9o80)
# Environmental survival:
Use charcoal at that phase (and change the tooltip)
We need to make the beneath slightly more useful at the moment
Make the primitive gas mask have around 20 minutes
# [[Rocket]]ry
Epix7 did get the launch pad to form! (good job)
We definitely are using the Advanced Rocketry fork now, but we will need to use some modifications of our own.

Starl0st’s renderer turns out to not work on 1.12, so we’ll just use the fork’s own rendering capabilities for now.
# Bugs we need to fix:
Fix invasions in peaceful mode
# Redoing GCYM?
- Cabal alloy blast smelter
- We can take a lot of the multiblocks from Warfactory once they finish that
# Weekly assignments:
- Divine Ray: Compose the announcement for the [[Screenshot and Structure Submissions]], as well as the [[ore voiding chain]]
- Super: soviet era mod (again)
- Bruberu: make all of the types of armors in environmental survival, look at platinum chain materials
- Blocky: finish up platinum chain and materials
- LRDMTNS: change the superalloys he selected to use the powder metallurgy process
- TheRandomScientist: get @\_tots_ to give him the recipes
- Epix7: talk to the AR fork devs about space development, and investigate GalacticCraft as a separate option
- # Later:

- Friedrich can check on the platinum chain/rare earth chain after this week
