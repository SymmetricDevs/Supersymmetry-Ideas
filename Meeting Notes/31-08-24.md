# Switching out for Advanced Rocketry’s fork
Rather than using the OBJ models, we should probably have the launch pad construct a BlockPattern like the autobuilder and then assemble it immediately using Advanced Rocketry functions. In the future, we will need to hold a custom object inside the launch pad for dealing with special modules.
- We do need to check in on StarL0st to see if he’s ported the block renderer for the entity
# Bugs we need to fix
We need to check on the modern warfare cubed rendering issues.
Fix invasions in peaceful mode  

We are still doing the armor-based version of Environmental Survival, as Divine Ray thinks that does not distract from gameplay too much.

# Building Submission Entry
We need to remember to make an announcement asking for building, and take in the [Soviet Era mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/soviet-era-mod). This is to add more [[Structures]]. 

# EV Implementation
If we actually intend to implement #EV progression ASAP we need to perfomr the following::
- Research superalloys (about 5 is good, make sure molybdenum and niobium are used)
- Maybe do new turbine blocks in the future?
- Research a platinum group chain
- Research a rare earths chain
- Research an EV-IV circuits chain, or alternatively push over the HV-EV chain to it once the transistors are done
- Done!  
Do first-order kinetics for Continuous Recipe Logic (As seen in [[Designing a Flow Assembly|Flow Assembly]])

# Who is doing what for this week?

- Lrdmtns - superalloys and prototyping some Groovyscript
- Divine Ray - ore voiding chain (2 machines, make it fast)
- Epix7 - get launchpad to form
- Starl0st - We do need to check in on StarL0st to see if he’s ported the block renderer for the entity
- Super - soviet era mod
- Bruberu - working on getting gas masks for environmental survival
