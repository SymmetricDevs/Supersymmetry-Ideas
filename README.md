Before, ideas and information were spread all over the place on github, discord, and so on. But organization will become more important as supersymmetry development becomes more active. This was made to keep track of the ideas and information surrounding supersymmetry, in one place. There is not really a format for submitting ideas.

Information about ore veins and machines to implement is here instead, due to it being more convenient to store in spreadsheet form: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fs8qD99pRDpkTqtLE6fJlXYYXZNGlIo_1DkdGxqAbm0

Stuff that is in progress is noted here: https://github.com/users/Zalgo239/projects/1
Pinned messages in the shadier channel also mentions stuff that is in progress

Very general progression (based on what transportation the player has unlocked):
