aliases:
  - Continuous Casting
---
A large multiblock specialised in high throughput casting of molten metals, primarily steel. 
Utilises an external coolant (preferably Water). A more specialised coolant could reduce material loss (read: less molten metal used per cycle) at the cost of cooling infrastructure. 
May use a set of shapes, acting similar to an extruder. 
Cast metal units are referred to as billets, which have to be cut whilst red-hot using an oxygen lance, as the metal undergoes combustion when faced with high concentrations of oxygen. 
Cutting and rolling is done in accompanying multiblocks (Welder and Large Bender/Roller)

Billet shapes may be:
- Ingot (Square shape) 
- Rod (May be cut into regular or long rods in the cutter)
- Slab (may be processed into sheets, foils and plates)
	- Sheets may be rolled up into coils as dense shipping item)
- Structural (like H/Double-T beams)
