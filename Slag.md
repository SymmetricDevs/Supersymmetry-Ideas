Slag is a (by)product of smelting and pyrometallurgical extraction of metals from minerals, which is typically seen as waste in this field. Slag describes the undesired compounds which settle separately from the metal in the furnace. 

It is categorised by the following:
- Ferrous (from Iron and Steel)
- Ferroalloy (from Iron and Steel Alloying)
- Non-Ferrous (from recovery of Cu, Ni, Zn, P)

Slag formation can be combatted and modified through introduction of e.g. quicklime (CaO) and magnesite (MgCO3). *If it is possible to implement,* too aggressive or radical slag constituents will attack and damage the refractory lining of furnaces. 

Contemporary applications of slag are dominated by the construction industry. Slag is ground and added to cement mixtures, but this only works with specific types of slag. Larger granules of slag (gravels) are used for railroad bedding and streets/roads. 
It can also be melted to be spun into mineral wool (Since SuSy currently lacks better/alternative solutions to making insulation/mineral wool). 
Slags can be dissolved in wastewater to generate acidity to promote flocculation (for which i’d prefer a unified flocculation agent). It is also a slow-acting phosphorus fertiliser.
