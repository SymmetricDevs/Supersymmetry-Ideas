## Life of a TARDIS

### Block Transfer Mathematics

The bulk of a TARDIS is made up of Block-Transfer Mathematics. This form of Distributed Cluster Algebra was first developed by the people of the planet Logopolis. It is based on the idea that the essence of matter is structure and the essence of structure is mathematics. Using the hexadecimal notations of Block- Transfer it is possible to create Space-Time Events through pure calculation. Any event or object can be described by thinking the correct Block-Transfer equations and it will instantly become reality. Block transfer equations can alter history itself. A sufficiently adept mathematical genius can project a temporary block transfer projection of himself through space and time just by reciting the right equations. With 11 other people reciting the right block transfer numbers it is possible, though difficult, for a Time Lord to track his TARDIS through space and time.

Block Transfer works by using pure mathematics to model the possible existence of a specific space-time event or piece of matter.

Thus any matter (or other space time event) can be created out of pure mathematics if its quantum possibility can be modelled. Because the equations have to function in multiple timelines, block transfer equations used in creating a TARDIS use Base Code Numerals which are numbers that are true in all Universes. Some examples would be the numerals Etra, Secque, Eram, Nol, Kayrie, Gorrock, Zel, Nerus, Av, Ressa, Carra, Otto, and Perdunesta.
These calculations are powered by raw energy. Block-Transfer Mathematics can only be computed with an organic brain because the mathematics alter the nature of reality. This would cause a traditional computer to malfunction. The original equations can however be recorded in traditional non-organic storage media such as bubble memory.

Matter created by a TARDIS using block transfer will have enhanced temporal properties and be resistant to being retro-annulled. This also makes it immune to the normal Vortex energies. Some (but not all) Gallifreyan technology is made of non-atomic matter.

### Hyper Loom (Conception of a Space-Time Event)

A TARDIS is not built it is grown. The process used to create a TARDIS is one of the greatest secrets of the Time Lords. The initial block transfer equations necessary to create a Complex Space-Time Event like a TARDIS can only be assembled in a null-zone connected to the Eye of Harmony. This null-zone is called the Hyper-Loom or sometimes the Womb. In a very real sense, Complex Space-Time Events like a TARDIS always exist. These Events take the form of a complicated coded-series of Block-Transfer equations, which define their existence and position across all of Space-Time. The equations are based on the fundamental principles of movement, travel and infinite recursion. They serve as the foundation for the Time Travel Capsule (TTC). Being a four dimensional being, a TARDIS assists the Time Lords in its own creation. Legend has it that the Matrix, the Mother of all Gallifreyan Timeships, has always existed and created the Gallifreyans just so she would have a point of origin. This same legend also states that the Matrix secretly controls the Time Lords.

The Hyper-Looms provide the Capsule with a block-transfer connection to the Prime Eye of Harmony on Gallifrey. It is this block-transfer connection that serves as the heart of the Complex Event. The Space-Time Event combined with the Eye of Harmony connection forms an Extra-Dimensional Framework known as the Metastructure.

### Gallifrey Black Hole Shipyard (Creation of a Time Travel Capsule)

After being connected to the Eye of Harmony, the Space-Time Event is moved to neural construction docks at the Gallifrey Black hole Shipyard to complete its growth. To protect Gallifrey from time pollution the Shipyard is located outside of Gallifrey's star system and is equipped with filter circuitry to generate Transduction Barriers. These barriers are also used to prevent the Capsules from escaping.

Inside the docks are numerous Dimensionally Transcendental Cradles (or Ubbo-Sathla) which hold the future TARDISes. The Time Lords alter this metastructure to make the Event dependent on the Symbiotic Nuclei of a Time Lord for its ability to travel in the Vortex. It is at this point that the Space-Time Event becomes a viable Time Travel Capsule.

TARDIS sentiences are created with a Block Transfer System using specific
Artificial Intelligence Code. Using birthing matrices the block-transfer A.I. is rendered and physically formatted into the organic Protyon Units that serve as the brain of a TARDIS. The Protyon Core is then implanted in the Space-Time Event and programmed with multidimensional Grey-Prints of the new TARDIS. Grey-Prints are designed by Gallifreyan Mathematicians and set down many of the specifications and capabilities of the new TARDIS including its gender. At this point the Capsule uses Warp Matrix (Transdimensional) Engineering to grow its interior and exterior shells. Using these Grey-Prints as guide, the Protyon Units grow the interior/exterior of the Capsule. The Cloister Room (with the link to the Eye of Harmony) develops first, followed by the rest of the Time Sceptre. The capsule's Transducer Power Cells are also among the first items to be grown.

After spending a decade in the cradles they are moved to the Solar Workshops, where several pieces of exitonic circuitry are implanted by the Time Lords. Exitonic circuits are made of a type of metal that has many of the characteristics of plastic. The implants include[/ttv] the Temporal Drive and Chameleon Circuit. If the Capsule is designated female, it will receive XX circuits, if male, XY circuits. Because only about 1 in 80 Time Lords are female, it appears that less then one out of every 100 timeships are male. Male TARDISes are sometimes referred to as bulls.

When running in a new TARDIS (or a TARDIS with a new Dynomorphic Generator), the operator should navigate an already established vortex wormhole (such as a Time Contour or a Time Corridor) to check out the temporal dimensions. This is a good way of testing the engines on low power it requires less energy.

### Types of TARDIS

Once the Protyon Units have generated the necessary interior and exterior shell the Capsule is considered to be a fully operational Time And Relative Dimension In Space (TARDIS) ship. Some capsules (which have received upgrades) have the word dimension pluralized to dimensions. This is because the TARDIS now has acquired extra internal dimensions within it is standard multidimensional nature. The pluralization could refer to the addition of a micro-universe within the pre-existing micro-universe. The word "Tardis" means Time-Ship, however the plural of TARDIS is still debated by Time Lords.

Each TARDIS has a plaque located in the Switch Room that says:

<p style="text-align: center;">TARDIS</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Time and Relative Dimension in Space</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Build Site: Gallifrey Black hole Shipyard</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Type ## Build Date: ####</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Authorized for use by qualified Time Lords only</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">By the Shadow Proclamation</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Misuse or Theft of any TARDIS</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">will result in extreme penalties and possible exile</p>

A numerical Type designates each model of TARDIS. Every TARDIS that is constructed follows the specifications of its specific "Type." For example the Doctor usually operates a Type 40 TARDIS. Higher Type numbers indicated later model TARDISes. The Type number is fixed. For example the Doctor's TARDIS is still a Type 40 TARDIS despite the numerous upgrades and modifications it has received over the years. If a TARDIS Type is particularly successful, then over 300 of that Type might be created. The Type 89 TARDIS is the most advanced non-military TARDIS yet created. Military TARDISes are known to go up to Type 94.

The fully sentient and interactive TARDISes created during the Time War are some times called Type 100s (Type 101, 105, etc...) but are more properly referred to a Form 101 or Form 103 etc... The Form 105 was the most advanced TARDIS known to exist during the Time War.

### TARDIS Cloning (SIDRAT)



With a sample of organic Protyon Units it is even possible to clone a whole new TARDIS using a fist sized piece of a pre-existing female Capsule. Indeed, even if a TARDIS suffers enough damage to reduce it to a 1 inch cube the molecular stabilizers will still be able to re-grow the capsule.

In either case, the regeneration occurs in much the same way that the capsule originally grew in its Dimensionally Transcendental Cradle. The capsule's Protyon Units will use warp matrix engineering to reform in endo and exo shells following the specifications set down in its Grey- Prints. This process will start with the Cloister Room and expand from there to reform the rest of the Time Sceptre.

With a Dimensionally Transcendental Cradle to feed it this re-growth will only take a decade. Without it, the new TARDIS have to rely on some other source of artron energy, such as that generated by being close to a Time Lord. When limited in this way the TARDIS will take thousands of years grow up. The growth of the exo-shell will be limited to about 4 cubic inches per year. Once the capsule's exo-shell has reached a size of about 2 cubic metres it will take about 90 years for its shell for its materialization beacon and to become active. The surface of the shell will also hum when touched by a Time Lord. Approximately 20 years after that point the regeneration mode will be completed and the TARDIS will allow the Time Lord entry.

At the end of this time the TARDIS will still need to have several pieces of exitonic circuitry implanted in it. These systems include the chameleon circuit, the gender circuits, and, most importantly, the temporal drive. Given the about of time the cloning process will take, an experienced Time Lord with the proper plans, will have plenty of time to build the necessary systems; even if they are limited to primitive Level 5 technology (such as that found on Earth in the late 20th century). In the case of re-growing a catastrophically damaged TARDIS it is possible that some or all of these components might have survived and the TARDIS will be fully functional.

One way to accelerate this growth would be to find a source of energized morphologically unstable organic material. Depending on the power levels, this could reduce the grow time to around a century. Similar results can be obtained by shatterfying the plasmic shell and modifying the dimensional stabilizers to a fold back harmonic of 36.3. This will accelerate its growth by a factor of 59. Continual exposure to Rift Energy can also help reduce the growth time to about 50 years.

It is not unknown for time aware species to attempt to illegally clone a TARDIS using this process. A fully cloned TARDIS (legal or otherwise) is usually designated with a Model number based on the Type of the capsule that provided the cutting. Hence the clone of a Type 60 would be know as a Model 60. It should be noted that an illegally cloned TARDIS would have the same Imprimature Signature as original donor TARDIS. Which means that the official owner of the parent TARDIS can be easily found by cross-referencing the TARDIS's Imprimature Signature against records on Gallifrey.

While some humans have been able to acquire Model 70 clones from Nekkistani on the world of Gryben, the most notorious examples of TARDIS duplication was Magnus the War Chief's construction of several TT Capsules for the War Lords. Though the Capsules were probably cloned from the War Chief's Type 42 (or 43) Capsule, his ally the Master failed to provide Magnus with all of the pieces of exitonic circuitry that would be necessary to create full operational Model 42 TARDIS clones. Most notably the timeships lacked the green crystal dynamorphic projectors. Since the crystals are only found on Gallifrey, other, less sophisticated materials had to be used, resulting in a capsule that was much more prone to breakdown. There were also no Chameleon Circuits installed on the ships.

These simplified TT Capsules were known as Space and Inter-Time Dimensional Robot All-purpose Transports, or SIDRATs. While capable of travelling over half a million years their range was more limited than the standard TARDIS. Their simplified design did give them a great deal of dimensional flexibility, allowing their internal architecture to be easily reshaped and they could hold thousands of passengers. As their name implies, these 'robotic' transports were designed to be remotely controlled. However, as with most forms of remote control, this drastically shortened the life of the time control units which are part of the dynomorphic projectors. Under continual use they rarely lasted more then a few weeks.

### Dry Dimension Dockyard Cradles (a.k.a. Berthing Cradles)

The TARDIS is then piloted to a Berthing Bay in the Dry Dimension Dockyard Cradles on Gallifrey and registered. Each TARDIS is given a Registration Code. These codes can be used to identify which Time Lord is responsible for a given capsule. All the Berthing Bays contain rows of Berthing Cradles, each capable of holding one TARDIS when it is not in use. The excess energy from telepathic discussions held in Gallifreyan Artron Forums is routed to these bays to supply the timeships.

There are hundreds of TARDISes on Gallifrey. Most TARDISes are designed to serve as mobile research laboratories and it takes a team of 6 researchers to make full use of TARDIS's capabilities. For this reason they rarely travel in groups. It is common for only a couple of TARDISes to be off Gallifrey at any given time.

### TARDIS Social Interaction

The adult TARDIS is a living, semi-sentient, creature of time calculations, trans-dimensional equations and exitonic circuitry. The Protyon Core is the organic brain of a TARDIS. Male TARDISes (or Bulls) tend to be dominant in TARDIS herds. TARDISes will "talk" to each other and indeed love to gossip about their pilots.

TARDISes believe that they were designed to be "as one" with time and space. They also believe that they are the ultimate evolution of the Time Lord race. A properly maintained TARDIS doesn't have emotions. But he or she can develop "affection" for their regular crew members Given the opportunity, they will occasionally be drawn, like insects to a light source, out of their cradles only to be found lurking near the Prime Eye of Harmony.

### Life On A TARDIS

While some Time Lords do use Time Rings, the TARDIS is the preferred method of travel when leaving Gallifrey. Time Lords have almost no interest in other methods of travel.

Gallifreyans who attend the Time Academies have their Biodata modified to include Symbiotic Nuclei, making them a Time Lord. On their first day at the "TARDIS Academy" each TARDIS chooses their Time Lord operator from the ranks of Junior Time Lords at the Time Academy. It is also possible (in some situations) for a Gallifreyan with a symbiotic nuclei to purchase a TARDIS.

Once chosen, a TARDIS uses its Symbiotic Relationship Circuits to form a symbiotic bond of transcendent biomechanics with the Symbiotic Nuclei known as the Rassilon Imprimature. The Rassilon Imprimature makes a TARDIS more then just a vehicle or even a beast of burden to a Time Lord, they are essential parts of Time Lord technology and culture. The semi-instinctual neural link between a TARDIS and its operator is almost sexual in its intimacy. Each TARDIS has a gender, and some believe they provides a sense of companionship for its Time Lord operator in much the same way that a husband or wife does for their spouse.

It is not unheard of for a TARDIS to occasionally leave a new arrival “welcome aboard” gifts. While the option exists for a TARDIS to form a link with all six of its Time Lord crew, it is impossible (or at least unethical) for a Time Lord to own more then one TARDIS. This is, at least in part, due to the fact that a TARDIS becomes terribly jealous when an operator is bonded to more then one. Despite all of this most Time Lords treat their Time Travel Capsule as nothing more then a utilitarian form of transport rather then as a living creature.

Only after graduation Time Lords are allowed to make solo trips in their TARDISes. Even though hundreds of Time Lords have a TARDIS granted to them they must still obtain authorization before using the TARDIS to leave Gallifrey. It is common for only a couple of TARDISes to be off Gallifrey at any given time. Most TARDISes are designed to serve as mobile research laboratories, for this reason they rarely travel in groups. It takes a team of 6 researchers to make full use of TARDIS's capabilities. Such a team will often consist of the TARDIS's Time Lord operator and 5 technicians or specialists, who might be Apprentice Time Lords or mere Gallifreyans. Officially it is forbidden to allow a lesser species into a TARDIS, but this law is often overlooked. Retired Time Lords are not permitted to own a TARDIS, and unauthorized use of a TARDIS carries a mandatory Death Penalty. It should be noted that, in the case of a Gallifreyan, death refers to losing a single life.

While a TARDIS's transportation of its crew through time and space is usually described as a "Journey" it is just as accurate to say that a TARDIS actually works by recording is crew's biodata and reprocessing/manipulating their future to take into account a different location in space and time. As part of this process the Auto-Systems ensure that the crew member's reality quotients remain at 1.

A TARDIS constantly generates a low-level telepathic field, which allows it to telempathically read the surface thoughts of its crew. This allows a fully functional TARDIS to guide lost crew members to their destination using glowing arrows on the walls. The movement of non-sentient animals within a TARDIS can be controlled by setting the TARDIS to deliver electrostatic shocks if an animal moves into forbidden area. A TARDIS with Time War era upgrades automatically reconfigures the architecture to make sure the room the crew member needs comes to him. Being four-dimensional beings, TARDISes are even able alter their architecture to accommodate future passengers before the ship's Time Lord knows that there will be a new passenger. This can extend to rearranging and creating new living rooms.

The Auto-Gravity System automatically adjusts the gravity, within reason, while in the Vortex to acclimatize the crew to the local gravity of the destination. The gravity can also be manually controlled and the setting of individual rooms can be configured separately.

The TARDIS has devices that will alter the metabolism of its travellers so they won't gain too much weight if they overeat. There is some evidence to indicate that never need urinate or defecate while on board the ship. The beneficial environment of the TARDIS can help prevent wounded people from passing out.

The Laundromat's laundry circuits automatically repair, clean, and iron any clothes left overnight in the sleeping quarters. Normally the auto-cleaning systems keep the interior of a TARDIS quite sterile and ensure that the atmosphere is automatically cleaned. There is only one known case of a poorly maintained TARDIS spreading an organic virus from one time zone to another, indicating that a fully functional TARDIS must have some sort of anti-viral software.

The environmental systems always play a very light melody in the background to soothe and relax the crew members. This melody sounds like a steady hum to non-Gallifreyans. The tone of the hum changes depending on whether the TARDIS is materialized or in the Vortex. While travelling in the Vortex the TARDIS always has a faint vibration, which vanishes when the ship materializes. A TARDIS has an optional diurnal (day/night) cycle. The duration of these cycles, if enabled, will be derived from the brainwaves of the authorized crew members

A TARDIS interior micro-universe is created using Transcendental Equations that don't interface with Normal Space in a traditional way. The Hynoleptic Interface's default setting creates numerous internal illusions to prevent lesser humanoid species who are travelling in a TARDIS from going insane.

Technically speaking vortex travel is instantaneous. For this reason, observant crew members will find that for every month they spend inside a TARDIS they will age slightly less then a week. There are reports that a human can live 2000 years while trapped inside a TARDIS, but this is unconfirmed. It should be noted that when energy supplies are completely depleted, the passage of time inside the TARDIS slows down relative to the exterior.

Though the TARDIS provides almost total protection from the energies of the Vortex, most crew members experience a subconscious sense of disconnection during vortex travel. This is the result of a cellular level awareness of being outside the first four dimensions. Some, (if not all) of a Time Lord's 22 temporal senses grow more acute the more times a Time Lord crosses the Time-Fields in a TARDIS. Because of this Time Lords are vulnerable to Temporal Shift Lag. Such effects can only be overcome if the Time Lord develops special mental disciplines. Temporal Shift Lag only effects beings with a symbiotic nuclei.

With each trip, the crew of a TARDIS will still be lightly irradiated with Artron Energy from the universe's background radiation. This chronon radiation can't be found in temporally stable environments and exposure can only occur by travelling in the Vortex. The amount of artron energy oxidants in the crew's DNA will incrementally build up with each trip. For this reason travelling in a TARDIS also has significant effects on the brain of any lesser species. The lymphocyte white blood cells will also mutate slightly under the influence of the radiation, but there are no negative side effects from this irradiation and it will never reach dangerous levels. The exposure does provide greater reserves for certain telepathic situations and will grant even lesser species a sensitivity to the changing of history. It might help a member of a lesser species survive travel though the Vortex and interstitial time.

Vortex travel will also cause the crew to accumulate Bockatrons, and Harminum, and other exotic particles. While most humanoids experience no side effects, a small percentage of life-forms that lack Symbiotic Nuclei suffer from Time-Sickness during flight. This usually manifests itself as strong feeling of dislocation but can take the form of headaches or digestive disorders.

Every TARDIS contains instruments for measuring these types of irradiation and thus verifying if the subject has travelled through the Vortex. These effects will show up very plainly in certain types of very advanced brain scans and the effect can be used to date the exposure. While it is possible to drain this energy out of a time traveller's DNA and put it to some sort of constructive use, under normal circumstances the levels of concentration will never fade.

### Death of a TARDIS



Every TARDIS has an expected life span of several thousand years but in modern times it is unlikely that any TARDIS will reach that age. One should keep in mind that most Time Lords tend to view their time capsule as nothing more then a utilitarian form of transport. Each successful Type of TARDIS will lead to the creation of hundreds of that model. However, given that there are only 1000 Time Lords at any given time it would appear most TT Capsules are scrapped after only a couple of centuries or less. In most cases, a TARDIS will be replaced as soon as its technology becomes obsolete and its operator can afford a newer timeship. In the 2000 years leading up to the Last Great Time War, capsules were often be de-registered well before the end of their expected lifespan. After being put to sleep by its owner, the old TARDIS is usually scrapped at the breakers.

Even if a TARDIS is spared the breakers, eventually, entropy will eat away at a TARDIS's systems until a major system failure occurs. For example, a TARDIS will die if it remains in a state of Dimensional Collapse for more than a few decades. When a TARDIS is near death, the flow of time between the interior and exterior begins to break down. Some areas will show the past, some the future. Some will be frozen in time, some will have accelerated reference frames. A TARDIS that is abandoned for around 3000 years will break down from lack of maintenance, leading to the death of the timeship.

A dying TARDIS will, if capable, travel to a secret TARDIS graveyard. But a mortally wounded TARDIS could rip a hole in the vortex as it moved through the Vortex. If the TARDIS is incapable of safely travelling then it might be forced to suffer in a near death state for centuries. If the TARDIS is incapable of reaching the Graveyard on its own it not unknown for the wounded timeship to send out a telepathic recall signal to any Time Lords who share a symbiotic link with it.

A TARDIS that dies with an active Eye of Harmony will jettison its interior. Its location at the time of death will determine whether the interior is dumped into the Space-Time Vortex or the Space-Time Continuum. It is for this reason that a TARDIS's owner is responsible for putting her to sleep when she is beyond repair.

If possible, a dying TARDIS will automatically time-link itself to another nearby TARDIS. When Time-Linked the dying TARDIS's chameleon circuit and desktop theme will instantly be re-configured to match the pattern of the healthy one. This will stabilize the flow of time inside the capsule.

The traditional method of putting down a disabled TARDIS is to use the time-link to pilot the dying TARDIS into the heart of a star. The healthy TARDIS to aid the dying one in reaching the star by generating a wormhole within the Vortex for it to travel along. This can be done by synchronizing the co-ordinates of both timeships, making sure the calibrators are online, and dematerializing at the exact same time. Care should be taken that the impact doesn't cause any minor shift the orbits of any planets in the star system.

Once the timeship reaches the heart of the star the energies found there will allow the dying time ship to reach the TARDIS Graveyard, located in an impacted pocket dimension outside of normal space and time. Very few Time Lords have seen this graveyard, but one such visitor reported seeing hundreds of decaying TARDISes. The Cloister Room will be the last part to disintegrate.

## TARDIS Navigation

This section gives a brief overview of the nature of the universe and the environments that a TARDIS has access to. It also has a detailed description of the standard stages of TARDIS flight, including dematerialization, vortex travel, and rematerialization. The section finishes with a list of various flight modes and options such as Emergency Stops, Remote Parallel Control, and Time Ram.

### The Ur-Universe

he reality of the Ur-Universe is an eleven-dimensional phenomenon. Random fluctuations of energy within the Ur-Universe produced the Multiverse in a big bang.[/ext Time was born as were matter and space. The forces of Good and Evil shattered, leaving only echoes. A similar process continues to occur throughout the Ur-Universe producing a sea of isolated universes. The lifeforms, called Intercreationals, are composed of these universes and exist in this sea. They are far more powerful than Chronovores (and Guardians) and can destroy universes by touching them.

### The Multiverse

The Multiverse was formed by a random fluctuation of energy called the Big Bang or Event Zero. This explosion created Normal Space (N-Space), and Exo-Space (which has negative coordinates). All of the various Parallel Alternate Universes would later be artificially created based off of this one. Each of these Universes exists by collapsing and expanding over billions of years. The Multiverse is made up of 11 dimensions: The three spatial (dimensions 1-3) and two temporal dimensions (4-5) formed first. The remaining 6 dimensions curled up into the size of a proton to become the Six-Fold Realm (aka Calabai-Yau Space). Its possible that a TARDIS could visit these higher dimensions or even collapse it so that they could explore lesser ones.

It is known that, before the Time War, there were well over 117,863 artificially created parallel universes located 'sideways' in time. Given that the artificialy created universes can create further universes, it is possible that there are an infinite number of universes. By the end of the Universe over 100 billion alternate versions of history will have been created. The Time Lords use the Axis to hold alternate timelines that are the result of failed Time Lord interventions. Some other universes are bound to a station in the inter-dimensional void. This Station Control holds between 400 and 1,700 universes.

Like all universes these universes are defined by the conscious choices of their inhabitants. It is relatively easy for a for a fully functional TARDIS to travel to a specific parallel universe if one knows that universe's phase shift, but this will strain and possibly damage a poorly maintained vessel.

The occurrence of the Last Great Time War changed this. The damage to the Web of Time caused the formation of the Lost Dimension. The Lost Dimension (aka the Void) is the space between each divergent reality and parallel universe. The formation of this wall was an attempt to protect the other realities from the Time War. The Void has no temporal dimension and nothing for the conscious mind to believe in. It is composed of pure Void Stuff, which is neither matter nor energy. Breaching the Void to reach an alternate Universe is nearly impossible and any timeship that succeeds will still suffer significant damage. While it is possible to send a message to a specific parallel universe it requires the power levels of supernova to transmit even a short message. Anything that passes through the Void will be contaminated by Void Stuff. The contamination can be visually identified by humanoids by placing red and blue filters over their eyes. While Void Stuff normally has no negative effect a breach in the universe will cause all Void stuff (and anything it has contaminated) to be pushed back into the void.

While Alternate Universes are nigh impossible to reach after the Time War, this is not the case with tiny 'bubble universes' that exist on the 'surface' of the main one. If a connecting rift can be found it is possible for a TARDIS to enter such a universe, but they would need to burn up several rooms to have enough thrust to do so. The operator is warned, however, that escaping such a universe will require not only the use of sub-routine Sigma 9, but also burning up about 30% of the TARDIS's storage rooms.

It should be noted that if a TARDIS that relies on scavenged fuel (as opposed to the Eye of Harmony on Gallifrey) travels into a another universe this would leave it without power. Fuel collected in this Universe can only be used in this Universe. The TARDIS would be dead unless a source of Gallifreyan energy or a local source of rift energy could be found.

### The Universe (aka Normal Space-Time Continuum, Minkowski Space)

The Normal-Space Universe (or N-Space) is the part of the Multiverse which contains the Time Lords and "classic" time. It is experienced by three-dimensional beings (such as Gallifreyans and Humans) as being made up of the first four dimensions-length, width, height, and time. These first four dimensions are sometimes referred to as Minkowski Space.

A TARDIS relocates itself in the conterminous time of N-Space by travelling in the Fifth Dimension	(the Space-Time Vortex). This allows it to visit any planet in the Universe and any point in that planet's history.

In actual practice some galaxies under the control of the Confederation have created Tollports that use infra-red flight paths to guide in ships that wish to travel through space or time in that galaxy. The 5 credit fees provide funding for barriers at dangerous hyperpasses. The Time Lords have agreed to pay this fee while operating in Confederation controlled galaxies.

### The Space-Time Vortex (The Fifth Dimension)



Also known as the Fifth Dimension, the Space-Time Vortex is the foundation for the first four dimensions. The Vortex was brought into being using a loophole of temporal physics. By constructing the Eye of Harmony Rassilon and the Other participated in the creation of the 5th Dimension (the Vortex) at the moment of Event 1. This act was an essential event, as earlier Gallifreyan researchers, and other higher evolutionaries had been accessing the Astral Vortex since the beginning of time.

Time itself is made up of individual particles called Chronons. While it is possible to transmat objects through space by breaking the object down into light-waves and pushing them through the space between the time particles such actions have limited applications for time travel. Unfortunately, wormholes are extremely difficult to stabilize in Normal (Minkowski) Space, due to the space pressures, but such pressures are absent within the Vortex. Unlike the first four dimensions the fifth (and sixth-eleventh) dimension is collapsed and folded into a space the size of an atom. This allows for the formation of the wormholes that a TARDIS travels through. Since the Fifth Dimension is the foundation of the first four dimensions, it is possible for a Travel Capsules to move from Minkowski Space and integrate into the Fifth Dimension.

When plotted out in three dimensions, the Vortex appears to be a glittering blue void with gold highlights. There is no air pressure within the Vortex and the time winds are such that they would destroy any normal matter by ageing it until complete structural breakdown occurred. Block-Transfer objects are immune to the normal Vortex energies. While most humanoids would die in seconds if immersed in the Vortex some Time Lords can survive in the Vortex by using a technique called Vortex-Walking. Artron Energy can exist in the Vortex, and indeed it is the Artron Energy of every sentient in the Universe that makes up the Web of Time.

Even for a TARDIS, Vortex travel isn't entirely safe. They are vulnerable to surges in the Vortex called Time Spillage. These discharges of energy in the Vortex come from and go to nowhere. Freak surges in the Vortex can create time spikes. While only a minor inconvenience for fully trained Time Lords, inexperienced operators can end up losing their TARDIS's time signature when they collide with the time spike. Without the signature the TARDIS wouldn't know where Galactic Zero Center is and it would be impossible to plot the route-map home. A TARDIS uses Vortex Shields to protect itself and uses muon based counter-magnetization to navigate this and other turbulence. Most TARDISes can handle Time Spillage with a rating of 7 on the Bocca Scale, but if overloaded a TARDIS will attempt an Automatic Emergency Landing. A TARDIS that is trapped by a Spiral Nebula's gravity field will need carefully plotted escape coordinates to break free. The Event One hydrogen inrush that created the Milky Way Galaxy generates an immense amount of time force, enough that it is almost impossible for a TARDIS to escape.

Other dangers include massive black holes in the Multiverse (which cause random gravity lenses), monopole turbulence (often created by starship plasma drives), Tuckson-Jacker force fields (often used in weather control systems), quantum mirages, substrate diversions in the Vortex, and crossing the Time Spiral boundary. If a TARDIS was to be trapped between a Vortex Rupture and a Subspace Infarction it would break up. There are also uncharted areas of the Space/Time Vortex. The Mandragora Helix inhabits one such area. The Mandragora Helix is a spiral of pure energy radiating outwards in ways the Time Lords don't fully understand. This energy is sentient and has a relationship to the position of the stars. It is also possible (but very rare) for a TARDIS to become trapped in a fractional dimension between the Vortex and N-Space. But the Vortex is not just a danger to a TARDIS. A TARDIS is also a danger to the Vortex. A mortally wounded TARDIS could rip a hole in the vortex as it travelled.

### The Web of Time (History)

The Web of Time, within the Space-Time Vortex, was constructed by Rassilon and the Other. The axis of the Web of Time is a vast transdimensional Time Spiral that encompasses the universe and serves as a foundation for all points in space and time. Its creation made it much easier for the Time Lords (and any other species) to travel in time but it also made it much harder for anyone to change history. The Observer Theory states that, for the changing of history to make any sense, there must be an outside observer who watches all of history and sees this change. The Eye of Harmony is that observer. The Eye of Harmony serves as an anchor for the threads of Continuity and causality of the Universe and probably sits at the exact centre of the Vortex and thus at the centre of the Web of Time.

Using the data collected, the Time Lords can observe and predict almost any event. In mapping out the Universe they rationalize it and create a permanent version of space-time. Because of this most primitive forms of time travel aren't capable of making major changes to History. The Web of Time is the structure that all future races used to build their own histories on. The Time Lords view History (aka the Web of Time or The Great Time Line) as high-order mathematical structures that can be predicted by powerful computers. However these processes are complex enough to be regard as living beings. Indeed some Time Lords (and all members of Faction Paradox) view history as a sentient being or beings (sometimes called Loa). Whatever the truth of the matter, it is known that the Web is capable of affecting the mind of a Time Lord. Indeed, due to density of strands in the Web of Time it is unhealthy for even a Time Lord to stand too close to the Eye.

It should be noted that the creation of the Web of Time also create Anti-Time - the opposite of the positive time. This timeless shadow of the Web of Time is just as destructive to causality and continuity as anti-matter is to matter. The theory of Anti-Time is viewed as superstition for millions of years.

The Rassilon Imprimatur biologically links a Time Lord to the Web of Time, making the foundation of the first four dimensions an integral part of Time Lord Biology and culture. This link means that Time Lords keep history largely unchanging merely by existing. Indeed they are so intertwined with the universe that they are a part of the Laws of Time and Space. An Osmosis Dampener or Transduction Barrier will put a blockade up in the Vortex that will prevent a TARDIS from travelling outside a defined area of the Space-Time Continuum.

Whenever another species causes enough temporal distortion to damage the Web an Interventionist (probably the CIA) is sent to prevent the species from causing further damage. While a single timeship exploding in the Vortex is no danger, the destruction of a fleet of 1700 timeships could rupture the Web of Time permanently.

### Gallifreyan Noosphere Parameters

The Time Lord's Noosphere is the field of thought and cultural understanding, whose limits are set by the Matrix's collection of data and the Time Lord mind's understanding of universal laws and imagination. A TARDIS can reach the edge of what a Time Lord can imagine (the Noosphere) and then a bit beyond.

The Back Time Field Buffers prevent a TARDIS from visiting Gallifrey's past. The Buffers can be breached, but it is extremely difficult to do this. Removal of the Relativity Differentiator will allow a TARDIS to travel into Gallifrey's distant past (before the Eye of Harmony), but it will prevent the TARDIS from changing its spatial coordinates relative to the current planet. For reasons that even the Time Lords don't understand, a TARDIS cannot enter the Kasterborous Sector in Gallifrey's immediate future. It is however, possible to visit Gallifrey's star system several million years after the fall of the Time Lords.

Despite the restrictions in and around Gallifrey, a TARDIS can visit the past or future of the rest of the Multiverse with only two limits. For the most part the Space Parameter is defined by the size of the Universe. A TARDIS will automatically stop when it reaches the edge of creation. It is limited by the boundary between is and isn't. The planetoid Hindmost lies so far from Gallifrey that a TARDIS would have to be specifically re-engineered to reach it.

A TARDIS cannot travel further back in time than around 3500 years after Event One (the Big Bang). This is approximately 10,000,000,000 years before Gallifrey's present (13,500,017,903 BC). This limit is established because of the danger to the universe a time traveller could represent. The laws of physics are still forming at this point, and the addition of any particle to Event One could change the entire universe. The other limit is dictated by the ability of a TARDIS to collect Artron Energy from the Prime Eye of Harmony on Gallifrey. The forward Time Parameter is located at approximately 3,510,000,000 years after Gallifrey's Present (10,000,000 AD). This forward limit of TARDIS travel was set because there are likely to be species in existence who have grown more powerful then even the Time Lords. Automatic Systems prevent a TARDIS from travelling beyond this point and will trigger a boundary limit error message stating "Time Parameters Exceeded."

Very few Time Lords have ever travelled to Event 2 - the end of the Universe. However, if an operator overrides the Automatic Systems his TARDIS will have to rely on its own copy of the Eye of Harmony. If the Automatic Systems are overridden then a TARDIS can travel forward until the universe begins to collapse. Beyond this point it begins to lose its anchor point on Gallifrey because time works differently. The controls will begin to lock up and then a TARDIS will be destroyed. An emergency re-materialization is the only known solution. If a TARDIS travels this far into the future it will require some time to recalibrate before it can dematerialize again.

The Parameters are also defined by the boundaries of the Vortex's Time Spiral. Any TARDIS that tries to pass this boundary would be destroyed and scattered throughout the Vortex. These parameters are wired into core of a TARDIS making accidental crossing a virtual impossibility. As back up, if the TARDIS is in danger of being crushed by the Time Spiral, a Boundary Error Alarm will sound. The Defence Unit can then be plugged to the console and the operator can then instigate an emergency landing, which will allow the Defence Unit to materialize on a “nearby” world. The Defence Unit can be found on Type 40 and later TARDISes.

### Dematerialization

This is the first stage of space-time travel. The Molecular Dematerialization Codes are needed to activate the laser trigger found inside the Dematerialization Circuit. The Symbiotic Relationship Circuits automatically input these codes if the operator is a Time Lord. It might be possible to bypass the codes and activate the laser trigger using a Light Accelerator. Once the circuit is activated Dematerialization begins with the sublaminar processes being modulated by a stepped series of quantum-depolarized frabjastanic couplings. The resulting gravimetric packets are then filtered through a reciprocating Brantix-Wankel amulator to convert their subneutronic spin from anticlockwise to inside out. This is necessary because the only way to enter the Vortex is by slipping through the cracks between one moment of time and the next. During the dematerialization phase the Relative Dimensional Stabilizer can be heard outside and, if the operator leaves the brake on, on the inside as well. Many Exo-Shell disguises are equipped with a Materialization Beacon which indicates both dematerialization and rematerializations. The Beacon can also be set to illuminate when there is one or more sapient being inside.

The TARDIS can take part of the surrounding environment with it when it dematerializes, but this requires some skill to accomplish reliably. The operator must use the dials beneath the console's dematerialization array to extend the Ionic Time Field. This is done by matching it to the energy signature of a nearby object. If that object's energy signature has been locked on to the TARDIS's engines then it is possible to take that object with the TARDIS during vortex travel and drop it in a new Time Zone. It is possible to move spaceships, or even entire towns through the Vortex using this technique but it is very difficult to accomplish. If programmed correctly, a TARDIS can dematerialize leaving whatever has recently entered it behind at the original coordinates. This is made even easier if the object is not fully in phase with the interior dimensions.

With the dematerialization complete the TARDIS's Harmonic Generator uses the subneutronic spin as a basic Space-Time Warping Template for a resonant harmonic/mesonic collapse of the interstitial mesh which opens and then seals the breach in space-time preventing any disturbances. The Space-Time Warping Template can be used to seal other types of breaches (see Temporal Fusion). If removed from the TARDIS the Space-Time Warping Template will appear to physically twist and warp. This is a neurological illusion caused by the template twisting the space-time structure of the neural network of the observer's brain. The amount of power being used by the TARDIS increases drastically during Dematerialization. Most of this power is converted into potential energy. To prevent this energy from discharging into normal space at the moment of dematerialization the energy is stored and slowly emitted from the Eye of Harmony in the form of Hawking Radiation. If a TARDIS is trapped in mid-dematerialization it will keep releasing chronometric particles from the event horizon. The energy will continue to be emitted until the TARDIS has "bled to death." After each materialization, it takes twelve minutes for the Time Rotor's Energy Storage Unit to power up for the next trip. This makes the Dematerialization Circuit the most power-intensive system in a TARDIS.

The Dematerialization process will be quite rocky if the thermo-couplings have been exposed to freezing conditions. For this reason it is important to keep the main doors closed if the exterior environment is sub zero. Dyestrial toxin clouds in the atmosphere can inhibit a TARDIS's dematerialization. For this reason the operator should ensure that a TARDIS moves through time to a point where there is no Dyestrial toxin before beginning spatial displacement. Strong shields, temporal fields, magnetic fields, or steep gravity gradients (like a black hole) can also interfere with dematerialization.

### Vortex Travel (Walrus Mode)

Travel within the Space-Time Vortex is the second stage of space-time travel. While within the Vortex the TARDIS operates in Walrus Mode. This keeps the pranantic waveform properly antifrated and keeps the timeship's reality quotient reduced to 0.9. The reduced reality makes it easier to travel through time. The Spatial Drive will activate automatically when a TARDIS has entered the Vortex. The Wormhole Generator, Stabilizing Devices, and Refractors will induce, generate, and control the wormhole that a TARDIS travels through in the Vortex. While wormholes are extremely difficult to stabilize in Normal (Minkowski) space, due to the space pressures, such pressures are absent within the Vortex. The Light Speed Overdrive is an essential component of the Wormhole Generator and thus is vital to Vortex Travel. Two crystalline jewels are necessary to the continued operation of the hyperbolic laser drive. In an emergency this Overdrive can be patched into a radio transmitter to send radio signals to anywhere in the universe.

The Dynamorphic Generators use revolution-induced gravity to convert the Artron Energy into Orbital Energy. This energy takes the form of energetic Muons, which provide counter-magnetization Thrust for travel in the Space-Time Vortex.	The thrust is controlled by the Velocity Override, which regulates and modulates the Time Rotor using a form of Block Transfer maths known as Forced-Matter Calculations. While often described in terms of a ship moving via thrust, it is technically more accurate to say that the wormhole flux is flowing by a stationary time capsule. The gyro dials display the status of the gyro-series which stabilize the TARDIS in the Vortex. Gravity from Normal Space has no effect on TARDIS travel.

In theory, once the coordinates and course are programmed in, a TARDIS will travel to its destination and materialize automatically. And if the Logical and Physical mapping techniques described in Stages 11-275 have been understood and implemented, i-o ambiguities should not normally create difficulties at this stage. In summary, the sentience of the Protyon Core guides the timeship to work with the currents and eddies and tides of the Vortex. Not only does this make for a much smoother trip, it also allows the TARDIS to remain in the Vortex for an indefinite amount of time. Most (if not all) TARDISes prefer the environment of the Vortex to that of Normal Space - however TARDISes have Curiosity Circuits. Without these circuits a TARDIS would never leave the Vortex.

In practice Time Lord supervision is sometimes necessary to avoid dangers in the Space-Time Vortex. For example, collision with other objects in the Vortex can be prevented using the Anti-Collision Control. The anti-collision device is part of the HADS and uses a coordinate override to change location. A level five alarm indicates a temporal collision has in fact occurred. Turbulence while in the Vortex is most often caused by altering the settings of the dimensional stabilizers, a malfunction in the relative drift compensator, or by feedback from the solar comparator.

If a TARDIS's navigational system and velocity regulator are reset incorrectly, the Control Room will accelerate to ultra-warp speed beyond the spatial limits of the noosphere parameters and into frontier of the unknown. In the process the hyper-sonic speed will flood the control room with Time Spillage. Jamming the Dimension Circuits of a TARDIS will prevent it from materializing anywhere. It will continue to fly through the vortex until its power supply is exhausted. Another danger involves the relativity circuit of the temporal balancing governor. If the default temporal recursion algorithms of this circuit and the back-up circuits are disrupted the TARDIS will accelerate backwards in time at a tremendous rate. The TARDIS must be brought under control using the velocity override before the speed exceeds six and a half googol years per metasecond or the ship will collide with Event One and be destroyed.

The vortex wormhole can be displayed on the scanner screen. A red tint is used for travelling forwards in time and a blue tint indicates travel into the relative past. Many people find seeing all of reality spinning by to be a disturbing experience. For this reason the scanner screen is often switched off during vortex travel.

While a TARDIS's transportation of its crew through time and space is usually described as a "Journey" it is just as accurate to say that a TARDIS actually works by recording its crew's biodata and reprocessing/manipulating their future to take into account a different location in space and time.

While travelling in the Vortex the TARDIS always has a faint vibration, which vanishes when the ship materializes. Using the PAST the TARDIS provides almost total protection from the energies of the Vortex, most crew members experience a subconscious sense of disconnection during vortex travel. This is the result of a cellular level awareness of being outside the first four dimensions. During Vortex travel some Time Lords are vulnerable to Temporal Shift Lag due to having 22 different types of temporal senses. Such effects can only be overcome if the Time Lord develops special mental disciplines. Temporal Shift Lag only effects beings with a symbiotic nuclei.

### Rematerialisation (Actualizing the Quadro-Anchor)

This is the third stage in a space-time journey. The operator should activate the Synchronic Feedback Checking Circuit (to ensure that the TARDIS does not arrive upside down) and the Multi-Loop Stabilizer (to ensure the TARDIS lands firmly on the nearest surface). The Safety Precaution Selector prevents a TARDIS from materializing in a dangerous location (see Safety Precaution Selector).

If the Time Lock function slips then the Landing Circuit will jam and a TARDIS will end up materializing in space - possibly in orbit of the planet it was supposed to materialize on. TARDISes can be forced to materialize at a specific location by an outside force using a navigational guidance distorter tractor beam.

Alternately, if a timeship's Dynamorphic Generators are not functioning at
full capacity, then it is possible for its course to be deliberately deflected by another TARDIS. This is done by materializing a TARDIS at the exact same space-time coordinates of the arriving timeship. If successful, the arriving timeship will be thrown back into space-time. If unsuccessful the operators risk Time Ram

When the TARDIS reaches the correct location in the Vortex it exits the wormhole. Right before materialization in a time zone whose History is uncrystallized the TARDIS releases a burst of Artron Energy to collapse the infinite number of possible timelines into a single crystallized timeline. A TARDIS also emits a burst of Tachyons right before materialization. Because of this, it is possible for lesser species to detect the imminent materialization of a TARDIS by watching for peaks in a warp oscilloscope, or gravity dilation meter. Shields rated at 7,300 megazones or a soft Icaron Field can prevent materialization, as can strong temporal, magnetic, or gravitic fields. Weather control systems, such as a Graviton, can pull a TARDIS off course. If a fault occurs that prevents a TARDIS from re-materializing, then the TARDIS will initiate an Emergency Stop.

For the non-time-sensitive, re-materialization looks rather simple. A TARDIS fades into view accompanied by the sound of the Dimensional Stabilizers. This sound will also be heard on the inside if the operator leaves the brake on. There is also a stirring of the air as the TARDIS physically displaces the local atmosphere. Many Exo-Shell disguises are equipped with a Materialization Beacon which indicates re-materialization. Those who are fully time sensitive can 'see' pseudo-metallic tentacles (the Dimensional Stabilizers) extend out of the Space-Time Vortex. Without the exterior shell, the real world interface appears to be a biomechanical crustacean with several waving fins (the Scanner and other sensors). The time-warp anchorage unit acts to stabilize the TARDIS in its new time zone while the Harmonic Generator then seals the vortex breach by collapsing the interstitial mesh with resonant harmonics to prevent disturbances. Every Re-Materialization leaves a temporary space-time track] in the form of residual Artron Energy in the Vortex.

The TARDIS Scanner automatically collects data from the landing site's radio, computer, and satellite broadcasts. Analysis of any local cities is made as well. All of this information is stored in the Data-Bank. Using the Telepathic circuits, The TARDIS automatically compensates for traditional jet lag. However certain malfunctions in the TARDIS systems can cause crew members to experience extreme jet lag. The last stage in a TARDIS flight is Stage 387. This stage involves zeroing the co-ordinate differential, so that the automatic systems can reactivate the real-world interface. After this the Main Doors can be opened.

It should be noted that the accidental opening of the Main Doors after the Stabilizers have been extended, but before the displacement field has engaged and materialization is complete, can cause severe disruption to the dimensional stabilizers, possibly resulting in a miniaturized crew and TARDIS. It is also dangerous to overlap the materialization fields of two different timeships, as this will jam the materialization and cause severe damage to both vessels.

### Microjumps (Short Hops)

This is a "short hop" through Space or Time, usually less then a few hundred miles or a decade through time. Microjumps through space are usually achieved by disconnecting the Time Element to prevent any temporal drift. Due to the Blinovitch Limitation Effect they are difficult to perform accurately and even more difficult to accurately reverse. Performing several micro-jumps in a row causes a build-up of residual Artron energy, which makes a TARDIS easier to track. It should be noted that the complexity of micro-jumps is directly proportional to the size of the universe the capsule is attempting to navigate.

### Temporal Orbit

A TARDIS which has materialized can be shifted into Temporal Orbit by bypassing the Time-Space Rationalizer. This keeps a TARDIS travelling back through time at the same rate that time is passing outside - a sort of a temporal free fall. As a result, time outside a TARDIS appears to be "frozen." The operator could spend weeks or years inside his TARDIS and, when he leaves the Orbit, he will find that no time has passed outside his TARDIS.

### Temporal Drift and Alternate Time

The Relative Drift Compensators try to keep the TARDISes positioned in both space and time stable by protecting it against time eddies, random molecular disturbances, and other fluctuations. It will cause the TARDIS to move towards and lock onto the nearest major centre of gravity. If a TARDIS is placed in space near a planet, the Compensators will draw the TARDIS down to the surface of the planet.

While in Hover Mode a TARDIS can be set for Temporal Drift by disabling the Relative Drift Compensators and engaging the Stasis Switch. This will cause a TARDIS to move forwards in time at a rate of 50 years a second. An indicator light shows when the switch has been engaged Unlike other forms of time travel the dimensional stabilizers will not be heard inside or outside the capsule. Though a TARDIS is not fully rematerialized in N-Space, the Scanner can still be used to observe the effects of the passage of time outside the vessel.

This system can even be used to temporarily examine the Alternate Time possibilities by jumping a time track. While in alternate time the Yearometer will be stuck in safety mode reading all zeros. The main doors can be opened, but if the crew leave the timeship they will discover that their reality quotient is too low to have any effect on events in the time zone. They will be ignored by all life forms they encounter and indeed be able to pass through some objects. The reality quotients of the crew will remain low until they leave alternate time or until the TARDIS's automatically corrects this wandering by moving a crystalline component back into place. At that point the crew will all snap back in time to the point where the TARDIS properly materialized before the journey into alternate time began.

A malfunction in the relative drift compensator often causes turbulence while in the Vortex. If a malfunction caused a TARDIS's gravitation bearing to de-rectify or the Lateral Drift Compensators to activate then the ship could drift away from the current time zone without its operator on board. The TARDIS needs to be in Normal Space for its temporal drift systems to be recalibrated. A TARDIS can use its temporal drift function without a Time Lord being on board. However, it will only be able to travel 1,382 years back in time before beginning to lose structural integrity.

### Automatic Emergency Landing

Several events can trigger an Automatic Emergency Landing. If the Navigation or Guidance Systems suffer sudden damage while in flight (such as a Critical Timing Error, or monopole turbulence), if the Main Doors are opened while in the Vortex, if the TARDIS is approaching the boundary of the Time Spiral, if exposed to time spillage with a rating of more then 7 of the Bocca Scale or if the Warp Ellipse Cutout Circuit detects an imminent collision with a vessel in spatial-temporal warp ellipse orbit. Under all these circumstances (and more) a TARDIS will use the coordinate override and the Pause Control to initiate an Automatic Emergency Landing on the "nearest" available safe place - preferably a habitable planet. If no safe place is available some TARDISes have been know to materialize inside themselves (see Space Loop). An Emergency Materialization can be manually activated by pushing a green button on the Master Control Console. This function can be used to get a TARDIS to home in on and arrive near the source of a broadcast signal of some sort.

### Emergency Stop (Free-Float)

While in Vortex travel the Emergency Stop function can be used to put a TARDIS into Free-Float mode. The hyper-dimensional neutraliser circuit halts the TARDIS's flight and suspends it in the inter-dimensional space of the Vortex. A TARDIS can suspend itself in the Vortex forever. Emergency Stops occur automatically if a "kink" is discovered in the dematerialization protocols or if a fault occurs that prevents a TARDIS from rematerializing.

### Autonomous Control

Some operators who have a very close relationship with their TARDIS have been known to enable Autonomous Control, which allows the ship to select its own Space-Time Coordinates and input them into the Directional Unit. Among other things, it can help ensure that the ship will materialize near what he is looking for (say a missing travelling companion). This is accomplished using the Intuition Circuits. The neural network uses the Astral Map's holographic representation of the Universe to make guesses about where the TARDIS should materialize.

If a TARDIS's options analysis switching loops become clogged with partially rejected parallels the TARDIS will effectively have Autonomous Control regardless of the operator's wishes. This might result in a TARDIS constantly taking the operator to time zones where the Time Lord's skills and abilities are needed most. In some cases a TARDIS has been known to automatically enact an emergency program to reach the timeship's operator. Some operators have even installed a switch to trigger such actions.

### Emergency Displacement System (EDS)

The Emergency Displacement System (EDS) is usually activated by the TARDIS in situations where the Hostile Action Displacement System would be insufficient to safeguard the capsule. By enabling the localized default setting the operator can also trigger the system with the push of two buttons. When activated, the EDS uses a type of microjump known as a Materialization Flip-Flop. Because this setting has its own logic loop it bypasses most of the guidance systems, resulting in a materialization in a theoretically safe location.

This safe location will take the form of a random 'nearby' point in space in time that could be up to several hundred miles and somewhere between 5 minutes to 500 years from the previous location. However, if the threat pursues the TARDIS into the Vortex, the ship will travel as far through time as necessary to escape from the danger, even if it means violating the noosphere parameters.

Using a Time Safety Jump the EDS can be limited to temporal jumps. By limiting the Flip-Flop to a shift through time only, the operator can
materialize the TARDIS inside a craft that was on a collision course for the capsule. This requires a fair amount of skill from the operator as timing is critical.

While designed to move the TARDIS to random safe location, this system can also be used to take the TARDIS to a random dangerous location by reversing the linearity of the proton flow. Materialization Flip-Flops tend to cause damage to a TARDIS that takes some time to repair and for this reason should only be used in an emergency.

### Curiosity Circuits

TARDISes prefer the environment of the Space-Time Vortex to the four-dimensional world. They have Curiosity Circuits to encourage them to leave the Vortex.

### Emergency Unit

When this small box is plugged into the Control Console it disconnects the entire co-ordinate sub-system of a TARDIS, which results in the TARDIS being removed from the normal dimensions of time and space and being relocated outside of Normal Space. Normally it is impossible to alter the coordinates once the TARDIS has activated the Spatial Drive, but the Emergency Unit is the exception to this limitation. The Unit can be used to remove a trapped TARDIS from a dangerous environment or course through the Vortex, but runs the risk of trapping it in the Land of Fiction (located within Conceptual Space). For this reason the Emergency Unit has a built in timer to warn the operator to log in the coordinate subsystems and leave as soon at the Time Rotor's Energy Storage Unit is charged- usually 12 minutes. After the Time Lords dismantled the Land of Fiction it is possible to travel through the void of conceptual space as long as one doesn't try to materialize until after one has left.

### Temporal Fusion

A TARDIS can be used to collapse an existing time couture by navigating through the corridor to close and seal the damage behind it. This is done using the[/ext] Space Time Warping Template that collapses a TARDIS's breach in space-time during dematerialization. If a malfunctioning TARDIS causes damage (such as a rift) to either the Multiverse or the Space-Time Vortex, it is sometimes possible to use Temporal Fusion to repair this damage by reversing the trip that caused the damage. While Temporal Fusion can seal the "rift", it often leaves a paradox scar that can have minor effects on local causality. It is likely that improperly performed Temporal Fusion could lead to Eigen Ram.

### Spatial Overlap

A TARDIS can materialize around an object. This object will then appear within a TARDIS's interior. A TARDIS automatically diverts these objects to the currently occupied control room, but this can be overridden to make the object appear anywhere in the interior that the operator desires. It is dangerous to materialize around objects with temporal or multidimensional displacement (such as another Time Travel Capsule).

If programmed correctly a TARDIS can dematerialize leaving whatever has recently entered it behind at the original coordinates. This can be done with objects that were spatially overlapped or objects that entered through the Main Doors.

### TARDIS Interlock

Two TARDISes can phase into (or materialize inside) one another, but they have to be operating on the same frequency. The frequency is adjusted using the Time Sensor Control. The Time Sensor Control fine-tunes the exact space-time coordinates of the atoms that make up a TARDIS. It also ensures the proper time setting, which must be within 1 x 10-9 nano-seconds. If the time setting is too low the TARDISes will go flying off in opposite directions. If it's too high, then Time Ram occurs. For this reason performing TARDIS Interlock violates 15,473 different Laws of Time. If one TARDIS has no shields then the other ship must lower their shields for Interlock to occur. If someone or something happens to be standing in the space where a TARDIS is phasing into during interlock the person or object will be atomized.

When two TARDISes are successfully Interlocked, they will appear to be inside each other. This can cause a Gravity Bubble by increasing the weak force flux beyond design limits. A Gravity Bubble will trap a TARDIS at its current Space-Time Coordinates. If the operators of both timeships work together the capsules can be separated without danger of damage. But without the help of the other Time Lord a significant power boost to the drive systems is necessary to escape the Bubble. It should be noted that prior reconfiguration of the Architectural Configuration Program can prevent Gravity bubbles (see Environmental Systems).

TARDIS Interlock can be used to capture and tow a more primitive TARDIS. Under such circumstances the only way to escape is for the captured TARDIS to reverse the time vector drive. The back surge will break the two ships apart. Such an action can tear a rift in the Vortex and also runs the risk of draining the transpower system to the point were it needs to be jump started to access the Eye of Harmony.

### Time Ram

If two TARDISes occupy precisely the same point in the Vortex (such as from a failed attempt at Interlock), then Time Ram occurs. It is one of the most dangerous things that an operator can do with a TARDIS. During Time Ram the atoms making up two TARDISes occupy exactly the same space. This is enabled by careful manipulation of the Time Sensor control. The chaotic forces between the two overlapping ships will grow until one of them explodes. While the attacking TARDIS sometimes survives in a Time Ram, a more likely outcome is that both TARDISes will be destroyed, as well their Eyes of Harmony. This will result in the uncontrolled release of enough Energy to destroy most of a solar system.

There is, however, there a small chance that one of the TARDISes will evaporate and the other will survive. In this case the energy released would only destroy all matter in a 2.4 km (1.5 mile) radius.

### Space Loop

It is possible to materialize a TARDIS inside the past version of that same TARDIS, but it requires overriding the Time-Track Crossing Protection Protocol circuit. If a TARDIS rematerializes inside of itself it creates a space loop, where the endo and exo-shell would joined. It should be noted that if the time setting is too high an Eigen Ram will occur.

If a Space Loop is successfully created, then the crew would be trapped within the TARDIS forever. The exo-shell is likely to undergo temporal drift, resulting in a distortion of the causality between the two interfaces. But it is possible to set up a controlled temporal explosion to escape.

### Eigen Ram

If an operator attempts to send a TARDIS back in time without changing the spatial coordinates there is a chance that the ship could travel back in time and Time Ram itself. Such an event would be known as an Eigen Ram. The Banshee Circuits would activate the Cloister Bell if such a course were entered.[/ext But if the vortex shields are not activated when a TARDIS dematerializes it could cause an Eigen Ram without triggering the cloister bell.

In either case, if Eigen Ram occurs there will be two time zones at war in the heart of the TARDIS. While lesser species will perceive only a severe distortion of their senses, all Time Lords travelling in both the past and future version of the TARDIS will be able to see and interact with each other (almost inevitably causing a violation of the First Law of Time). The operators will only have just over 5 minutes to alleviate the situation before the paradox blows a 30,000 square kilometre hole in the space time continuum. The resulting black hole will be strong enough to eventually swallow the universe. Such an event will, of course, cause the cloister bell to ring. The solution is to turn the TARDIS's Eye of Harmony into a supernova at the instant of destruction using the following procedure.

1. Vent the thermal buffer
2. Floor the helmic regulator
3. Fry the Zyton-7 Crystals

The Supernova will cancel out the collapse of the two black holes merging, causing all matter to remain constant. The Operator will, of course, have to replace the Zyton-7 crystals afterwards.

### Time Control Unit

A Time Control Unit is a golden sphere about the size of a Cricket ball. All TARDISes have one of these devices, which can be used to remotely control a TARDIS by broadcasting Stattenheim signals that travel along the time contours in the Space/Time Vortex. It allows a minimum of two Time Lords to (with some difficulty) telepathically remote control a TARDIS that the Time Control Unit is linked to. The Time Control Unit can be detached from the console and taken into the field. Some Time Lords have used it to shift one end of a Time Corridor to a different point in time.

### Remote-Parallel Mode

Using the Tracking Monitor Control Board, the navigation units of ] two TARDISes can be Remote-Paralleled so that wherever one goes the other will go too. If the power ratios are correctly known and balanced this function can even be used on another TARDIS that is being tracked by the Time Path Indicator.

A variation of this function allows an operator who has access to the Control Crystal of another TARDIS to use his console to enact complete Parallel Control over the other TARDIS. This allows him to remotely operate almost all the systems of the other TARDIS. Parallel control can even be used to have precise control over a TARDIS equipped with a symbiotic bypass.

Both forms of parallel control can be thwarted by reversing the time vector drive. However this tears a rift in the Vortex and drains the power of both TARDISes to the point where there is not enough to jump start the systems.

### Remote Control

This system allows the High Council of Gallifrey or the Celestial Intervention Agency to control any TARDIS with a Recall Circuit whose location is known. They can force it to materialize in any Time Zone and prevent dematerialization. As with most forms of remote TARDIS navigation, use of the Remote Control drastically reduces the life span of a TARDIS's Zyton-7. Should an operator find a way to override Remote Control, the Time Lords can use Collection Beams on any dematerialized TARDIS whose location in the Vortex is known.

Circuits that allow Rassilon to override the commands of a Time Lord operator are traditionally installed on all TARDISes. These same circuits can also be controlled using the Ring of Rassilon. In a similar fashion, the original Worshipful and Ancient Law of Gallifrey serves as a "key" to the Time Lord prison asteroid, Shada. When the pages of this book are turned while within a TARDIS the book will use Remote Control to pilot a TARDIS to Shada.

### Recall Circuit

The Recall Circuit is a five-sided crystal with circuits embedded into it that, when it receives the right Stattenheim signal, can force a TARDIS back to Gallifrey. Stattenheim signals travel along the time contours of the Space-Time Vortex. In a Mark II console it is stored inside the base of the console. In a Mark VI console it is mounted on panel 6.

The Recall Circuit is almost never used and requires authorization by the High Council. However, when its use is authorized, the Time Lords can punish operators who resist its summons by steering the rebellious TARDIS into dangerous situations and then deactivating all the defensive mechanisms. Because it is integrated with the Main Space-Time Element it is difficult (but not impossible) to remove without disabling the TARDIS.

### Trans-Replicator Mode

When activated, this causes a TARDIS to swap locations with another nearby pre-selected TARDIS provided that both capsules have been set to Trans-Replicator Mode. The idea behind this system is to allow for the easy return and replacement of a damaged TARDIS that needs repair. Thus Trans-Replicator Mode will still operate even when one of the timeships is in need of major repairs. It will also function even when one of the capsules is trapped by external forces.

### Stattenheim Remote Teleport Control

Normally operating a TARDIS by Remote Control drastically reduces the life span of the Time Control Unit's Space-Time Element. The Stattenheim Remote Teleport Control is a method of remote TARDIS control that does not cause this damage. With it a Time Lord can summon his TARDIS to his current location at the push of a button

The system was secretly perfected around the time of the War Lord Malfeasance Tribunal. The CIA installed this newly developed system on capsules being used by their agents, like the Proto-Type 97. Its existence would not become general knowledge for almost 450 years. The system is found only Capsules that have the Mark X refit installed. It takes several days worth of work to uninstall a Stattenheim Remote Teleport Control.

The Statenheim Control uses a teleport control which sets up a twin symbiotic link to the central diaphragm. The hand-held Recall Button Disc broadcasts a Stattenheim signal through the Vortex, which summons the operator's TARDIS when the operator is in the field. Any Time Lord with a properly tuned Recall Disc can exert dual-control over a TARDIS with this system. The Disc can also be used to get a TARDIS dematerialize and enter a parking orbit in the Space-Time Vortex to await summons. When not in use the small black Recall Button Disc is stored inside a transparent dome built into the console.

### Dreamtime

It is possible to restructure a TARDIS so that it can be "materialized" within the conscious (or unconscious) mind of a sentient being - including the mind of the Time Lord who is symbiotically linked with it. This is possible because a TARDIS is not composed of real matter but collections of Block-Transfer Equations. Piloting a TARDIS into its operator's Dreamtime is very difficult and dangerous for both the TARDIS and the operator and will result in severe damage to the TARDIS.

### Time Loop

A Time Loop is a distortion in the Fourth Dimension where time folds back on itself. A TARDIS can be programmed to time loop an area at least 100 meters long. This is very difficult to do and results in a TARDIS (and the operator) being trapped in the Time Loop. It is possible for a TARDIS to escape from the Loop, but this is even more difficult to achieve. Stopping the Time Rotor while in the Vortex might allow a TARDIS to escape from some types of Time Loops (but not Chronic Hysteresis). It is possible for a vessel trapped in a Time Loop to be forced free by another TARDIS in the Vortex.

It is also possible to set up a temporal bubble around a particular room within the TARDIS, effectively trapping everything within the room inside an endless time loop. Under certain dangerous situations the TARDIS will automatically put the inside of the control room into a time loop to protect the crew within such a temporal bubble.

### Time Corridor (aka Kontron Tunnel)

A time corridor is a form of space-time travel that involves creating a wormhole through the Vortex that is connected to two different space-time zones, and is stable enough to allow unprotected humanoids to travel it. The traveller needs only to step into the Time Corridor to be instantly transported to the other end. Because these wormholes are very similar to the ones used by a TARDIS it is quite easy for a TARDIS travelling in the Vortex to be caught in a Time Corridor and be drawn along it to its destination. The time stresses of being caught in a Time Corridor can accelerate a TARDIS to such a high speed that it could break up if it tries to escape. There is also a chance that the TARDIS could be damaged by time particles colliding with its multidimensional implosion field. With proper modifications a TARDIS's Time Control Unit can be used to shift one end of a Time Corridor to a different point in time.

### Time Drill

A herd of TARDISes (locked in Parallel Control with a lead TARDIS) can be set to travel in a closed time-like spiral through the Space-Time Vortex. Moving at a billion years a second this Time Drill can penetrate almost any temporal distortion or barrier (such as a Time Loop). It will also destroy any TARDISes involved.

## TARDIS Guidance Systems

It's no good being able to go anywhere in time and space if you always arrive in the middle of deep space or at the centre of a star. This section examines in detail the various systems that get a TARDIS going where its operator wants it to go, or not as the case may be. In particular, it contains a guide to the various TARDIS Control Rooms, including all the known variants of the Doctor's Console Rooms.

### Symbiotic Nuclei

Time travel makes sapients vulnerable to the influence of powerful transtemporal beings that exist outside of linear time. These beings will try to force the time traveller to become their agent/servant. It is for this reason any species that wants to become a stable, time-active race must alter itself. Gallifreyans who attend the Time Academy have their Biodata modified to include Symbiotic Nuclei, making them Junior Time Lords. This done by anointing them with Time Energies from the Eye of Harmony. Symbiotic nuclei can also be added to a subject's biodata by injecting them with Retro DNA serum in the form of a red liquid. The Nuclei are probably located in a Time Lord's hearts.

The Symbiotic Nuclei maps the Time Lord into the Space-Time Vortex with Block-Transfer Numbers. They become linked to the heart of space-time and capable of changing their time-state by thinking the right Block-Transfer equations. It also allows them to withstand the energies of the Vortex.

This symbiotic nucleus is needed to implement the Rassilon Imprimature on a Time Travel Capsule (such as a TARDIS). To achieve the full rank of Time Lord a Gallifreyan must be granted a TARDIS and form a symbiotic link with it. This Imprimature gives the Time Lord access to the Power of Creation.

This link means that Time Lords are constantly sending small temporal waves throughout the Universe. The Symbiotic Nuclei cannot be removed from a Time Lord without killing them. They can be permanently deactivated by the right type of mutagen. Such a deactivation would eliminate a Time Lord's powers and his ability to regenerate.

### Rassilon Imprimature (aka Symbiotic Relationship Circuits)

The Rassilon Imprimature is the legendary link that a Time Lord shares with his TARDIS. To achieve the full rank of Time Lord a Gallifreyan must be granted a TARDIS and form a symbiotic link with it. On their first day at the "TARDIS Academy" each TARDIS[/tv chooses their Time Lord operator from the ranks of Junior Time Lords at the Time Academy. It is also possible (in some situations) for a Gallifreyan with a symbiotic nuclei to purchase a TARDIS.

Once chosen, a TARDIS uses its Symbiotic Relationship Circuits to form a symbiotic bond of self-regenerating transcendent biomechanics with the Symbiotic Nuclei that is woven into the Time Lord's very being. This Rassilon Imprimature is based on irrational numbers and imaginary equations. Because of this shared artron field, a bonded Time Lord's artron energy levels are greatly elevated, and the Gallifreyan can now access the greatest of all Time Lord abilities - the Power of Creation. As part of this Imprimature, the TARDIS idiosynchronizes itself to the operator's metabolism giving the operator quasi-symbiotic control of a TARDIS. This ensures that the will of a Time Lord Operator always overrides the will of a TARDIS's Artron Center. The Telepathic Induction Circuits are an essential part of this system and their removal will sever the symbiotic link.

To initiate a link the following procedure is used.

1. The operator will type "INFORM NEXT" after the "NEXT" prompt on the console's visual display unit (VDU). The VDU will read "NEXT = HELLO TARDIS."
2. To run the program type "HELLO TARDIS." The program will respond with "HELLO <operator's name> + CHECKING." The VDU will then scroll through the dematerialization code as the Symbiotic Relationship Circuits checks the operator's Symbiotic Nuclei and forms the bond. The VDU will then read "CHECKING COMPLETE + <list Fault locator damage report> + OTHER FUNCTIONS GO + NEXT".
3. The operator can then type "INFORM NEXT" which will result in the VDU displaying "3. ENTER DESTINATION + SPACE-TIME CO-ORDINATES". At this point the TARDIS is now ready for normal operations. See Dematerialization Procedures

Even though all full Time Lords have a TARDIS assigned to them they must still obtain authorization before using it on a mission. The Imprimature Signatures of all Time Lords/TARDIS unions are recorded in the Records section of the Berthing Bay Imprimatur Cortex. This Cortex is directly linked to each TARDIS's symbiotic Relationships Circuits. While the official owner of any TARDIS can be checked by cross referencing the TARDIS's Imprimature Signature against these Records, an illegally cloned TARDIS would have the same Imprimature Signature as other original TARDIS. It is possible to "rekey" a TARDIS by severing the symbiotic link but this requires hours of work by a certified TARDIS Systems Technician. Scrambling the Berthing Bay's Imprimatur Cortex would permanently disable the symbiotic relationship circuits of all the TARDISes on Gallifrey, preventing any of them from entering the Vortex. Only the Lord President of Gallifrey has the authority to initiate such an action.

No substance can survive the time winds of the Vortex without a Molecular Stabilization System. For this reason, the Symbiotic Atomic Nuclei is needed to 'prime' a Time Travel Capsules, form a quasi-symbiotic link with the Capsule, and to prevent the Capsule from molecularly destabilizing in the Vortex. The symbiotic-link between a Time Lord and his TARDIS allows the TARDIS to access the Dematerialization Codes from his symbiotic nuclei. When the Rotor Control is activated the Briode-Nebuliser absorbs a symbiotic print of the Codes from the operator's Nuclei. This genetic link serves as a genetic key for the Dematerialization Circuit to access the Vortex and as programming code for the Molecular Stabilizers. The Nuclei serve a similar function with Time Rings and other trans-temporal technology.

The nuclei are essential to initiate and survive long term travel in the Vortex. Most attempts to use a TARDIS without a symbiotic nucleus result in severe wounds and eventually death for the operator. The Capsule itself will be destroyed by the Vortex after several hundred years. The safest way for someone without a symbiotic nuclei to perform any sort of space-time jump is to use the Emergency Manual Override of the Hostile Action Displacement System A TARDIS can also use its temporal drift function without a Time Lord being on board. However it will only be able to travel 1,382 years back in time before beginning to lose structural integrity.

It is possible for a Time Lord to leave a thin membrane of symbiotic print by paring the nebuliser's interface. This membrane will allow a TARDIS to enter and exit the Vortex once without the presence of a Time Lord. If the coordinates have been pre-set then the Remote Control Facility allows a TARDIS to make a space-time jump without having an operator on-board Using the Manual Symbiotic Bypass Controls it is possible to permanently bypass the nebuliser and operate a TARDIS without a Rassilon Imprimature.

A TARDIS generates a low intensity telepathic field of Artron Energy. This telepathic field leaves a "thumb print" of the Time Lord's Symbiotic Nuclei and can be used by others to identify the operator of a TARDIS even after it departs. These prints get even more noticeable if a TARDIS makes a bunch of short hops. However this trail can be distorted by bypassing the Symbiotic Relationship Circuits.

Through the Rassilon Imprimature a Time Lord becomes able to detect his TARDIS's location from several dozen meters away, and predict when materialization is imminent. A Time Lord who is very close to their TARDIS can probably send a telepathic message which will cause its Eye of Harmony to detonate in a massive explosion that would destroy everything for miles. The link even allows the Time Lord to detect a badly wounded TARDIS's "cry" of pain and feel when his TARDIS has been destroyed. This exchange works both ways. If the operator suffers a serious mental trauma it can disable many of the TARDIS's systems including the telepathic circuits.

The Rassilon Imprimature makes a TARDIS more then just a vehicle or even a beast of burden to a Time Lord, they are essential parts of Time Lord technology and culture. The semi-instinctual neural-link between a TARDIS and its operator is almost sexual in its intimacy. Some believe a TARDIS provides a sense of companionship for its Time Lord operator in much the same way that a husband or wife does for their spouse. While the option exists for a TARDIS to form a link with all six of its Time Lord crew, it is impossible (or at least unethical) for a Time Lord to own more then one TARDIS. This is, at least in part, due to the fact that a TARDIS becomes terribly jealous when an operator is bonded to more then one. A TARDIS dims its lights when attempting to communicate with its operator.

There is at least one known case of a Time Lady linking herself to her TARDIS's Protyon Core at the exact moment of her regeneration. The artron energy was channelled into the TARDIS causing the two of them to become, in essence, one being, with the TARDIS functioning as her body.

If a TARDIS is abandoned by its operator it will deactivate most of its systems, and alter its appearance as necessary to avoid attracting attention. In theory, the death of a TARDIS's Operator causes the Capsule to automatically return to Gallifrey. However in many cases, the death of the Time Lord Operator can cause a grieving TARDIS to lose power, and shut down. Sometimes it even collapses the interior. The Exo-Plasmic shell will suffer isomorphic mass degeneration. If someone forms a new symbiotic link by idiosynchronizing a TARDIS to respond to a different metabolism, a TARDIS will revive. Some TARDISes in such a state will grieve for millennia, whilst others will die if no Time Lord forms another symbiotic link after a few decades. After the death of an operator with which the TARDIS was particularly close some TARDISes travel to a secret TARDIS graveyard located in an impacted pocket dimension outside of normal space and time. Very few Time Lords have seen this graveyard, but one such visitor reported seeing hundreds of decaying TARDISes.

### Passenger Adoption Scanning Terminal (PAST)

The Passenger Adoption Scanning Terminal (PAST) plays a vital part in the TARDIS' control circuitry. No substance can survive the time winds of the Vortex without a Molecular Stabilization System. For this reason, a Symbiotic Nuclei is needed to 'prime' a Time Travel Capsules by serving as a genetic key to access the Vortex. The nuclei also contains the programming code for the Molecular Stabilizers that prevent the Capsule from molecularly destabilizing in the Vortex. While Symbiotic Relationship Circuits allows the TARDIS to share in the Time Lord's protection they do not provide protection for any crew members or passengers who do not have their own symbiotic nuclei.

Most attempts to use a TARDIS without a symbiotic nucleus result in severe wounds. Zygma energy will split open the victim's DNA Helix, causing their protenoids to fall out of balance. There is no cure. The only treatment is using a distillation chamber to drain the untapped artron energy of sapient beings. But the more cells of energy the victim absorbs the more the catalytic extraction will destroy his metabolism and mutate his body, eventually leading to death.

It is for this reason that the Passenger Adoption Scanning Terminal was created for the Type 26 and all future TT Capsules. It uses rho waves to alter the mental and physiological processes of the crew. This even allows lesser species to survive Vortex travel. This molecular stabilization system will even provide time travellers with temporary protection from having their own biodata altered by a change in history. While this grace period is not indefinite it can often provide the crew with stable memories and physiology until the damage to history has been rectified.

If there is a symbiotically bonded Time Lord on board, the PAST will automatically screen and adopt any sapient life-form which is present at the moment of dematerialization into the Vortex. If there is no symbiotically bonded Time Lord (a Symbiotic Bypass) at the moment of dematerialization the PAST will not adopt any other life-forms.

Though the TARDIS provides almost total protection from the energies of the Vortex, most crew members experience a subconscious sense of disconnection during vortex travel. This is the result of a cellular level awareness of being outside the first four dimensions. Some (if not all) of a Time Lord's 22 temporal senses grow more acute the more times a Time Lord crosses the Time-Fields in a TARDIS. Because of this Time Lords are vulnerable to Temporal Shift Lag. Such effects can only be overcome if the Time Lord develops special mental disciplines. Temporal Shift Lag only effects beings with a symbiotic nuclei.

As of the release of the Type 32 TT Capsule the PAST also became responsible for ensuring that every crew member has access to the Voice Integrator. In theory only the crew of the TARDIS will be able to experience the Voice Integrator, however, some TARDISes have been known to selectively adopt certain acquaintances of the crew.

Because some time zones have lack sufficient light in the visual spectrum the Linear Calculator will adjust their eyes to see in the dominate EM spectrum of that particular time zone. The modification is accomplished with the telepathic circuits in such a way the that crew are unlikely to notice any changes to how they see the world. Operators should be aware that if the Linear Calculator is not serviced every 500 years it can cause miss-jumps.

Using the Telepathic circuits, The TARDIS automatically compensates for any traditional jet-lag its crew might experience. However certain malfunctions in the TARDIS systems can cause crew members to experience extreme jet lag.

The Auto-Gravity System automatically adjusts the gravity, within reason, while in the Vortex to acclimatize the crew to the local gravity of the destination. Again the telepathic circuits prevent the crew from noticing these changes.

While this version of the PAST has been used for some time, it does allow unknown stowaways to also share in this Time Lord gifts. For this reason some more modern capsules (Type 65 and later) are equipped with a scanning booth which must be used by any newcomer to be added to the Approved Entrance File. This is necessary if they wish to safely enter the Vortex.

### Control Rooms

A Control Room is located in the Control Sphere. It is the nerve centre of a TARDIS and serves as the bridge or cockpit. It takes 95% of a TARDIS's processor power to comprehend the universe from its operator's three dimensional point of view, and thus understand what the operator wants it to do. To reduce errors and miss communications all major functions and almost all minor ones can be monitored and controlled from the time and space mechanisms in this room.

The design of this Control Room is a three-dimensional model of a TARDIS's 4 dimensional Heart. Dominating the centre of every Control Room since the Type 20 TARDIS is a large free-standing Master Control Console. Most (if not all) of these timeships are designed to be operated with six pilots. At least one, if not all, of them should be Time Lords who are symbiotically linked to the TARDIS. This is why almost all control assemblies have 6 sides. The console is equipped with numerous controls, read-out displays and screens. Some consoles are equipped with a central Time Column that provides continual data on the Dynamorphic Generators. The casing of the Control Console is resistant to time winds that would badly damage even a Time Lord. Most of the controls are made of steel or plastic. The console is directly connected to a TARDIS's power source.

Inside, their biomechanical and tri-gamma circuitry is held together with Mergin Nuts. Laser operated relays transmit light along fibre optic cabling. The Heisenberg Circuits control a console's form and structure and are quite useful during bicentennial refits. If the psychosculpture illusion of the Environmental Metaphor's Desktop Theme is relaxed the Control Console appears to be a multidimensional "thing" that would drive lesser species insane. The Heisenberg Circuits are capable of reducing or increasing the total number of panels if desired.

Each of the six panels or "stations" on a console is assigned a number. However these numbers can be assigned clockwise or counter-clockwise depending on the Mark number of the Console. Each of these six panels has a standard designation that is independent of the number, which varies from refit to refit. The official designation of each panel dates back to the Time of Legend.

Tradition keeps this terminology in use even though modern console designs varies greatly from those original classifications. The following list outlines the controls found on each type of panels. For lists of the alterations and variations found for different desk-top themes and differ marks of refit see the sections Desk-Top Themes and Refits.

- Vortex Position Display

Normally the panel with the Main Door Control is the one closest to the Main Doors, but the Console can be set to rotate if the operator would prefer a different orientation. The console can be reconfigured to alter the location of the instruments and controls if the operator desires. A switch on each panel triggers the opening of the panel for easy access to the internal components and circuits. Entire panels can be swapped around to match a configuration that the operator would prefer. It is possible that all the controls of a console are labelled in a way that can only be "seen" using one of a Time Lord's 22 temporal senses.

For more complex or lengthy programming a larger and easier to use data-bank keyboard can be extended out of a control panel using a switch located beneath the console. If the Isomorphic Security System has been set, then only the proper Time Lord may use the controls. Parts (or all) of the console can be electrified using the Immobilizer Switch. A digital TARDIS manual can be accessed from the console by pressing a button marked "Manual". The interior lights can be controlled from a switch on the console and can be raised to painful brightness.

TARDIS technology interfaceTARDIS technology interface TARDISes can interface with lower tech devices (such as image translators, radios and cell phones) fairly easily and a large collection of sockets and connectors can be found beneath a hatch on the console.

The Main Doors are always located in the active control room. From the Control Room the Time Lord operator can access the rest of the TARDIS via a dimensional bridge which leads to the Core Service Module. The Master Control Console can be made to appear outside the TARDIS's Exo-Shell if the operator uses the Architectural Configuration Program to locate the Console outside on the end of a dimensional juncture link. Once configured in this manner the Console can be physically transported independently from the rest of the TARDIS and yet still maintain its link. Travelling the Vortex with just a console and no proper exo or endo shell is very dangerous. The console can be used to form a spherical materialization field around it when it travels, but protection is minimal. It is recommended that safety belts be worn.

The pedestal the console is attached to is called the Console Stem. There is a slot in the console's stem for playing large data cartridges as well as a computer interface plug behind a panel. The power outlet sockets are located beneath the Power Monitor Panel on the Console. They can instantly adapt to the power needs of any apparatus requiring energy. Using the TARDIS's power conduits some types of space ships can be recharged. This takes 3-4 hours.

If the operators are expecting a large amount of turbulence, Safety Belts (also known as seatbelts) can be connected to the Master Control Console and hold the operators next to the console. If there are more then six crew members then two padded couches with safety belts can extend out of the wall by activating a switch on the Control Console. In an emergency Oxygen Masks supplied by tubes will drop from the ceiling. There will be one mask for each crew member

A large hexagonal Power Source hangs above the Master Control Console. It collects unused Artron Energy from the central column and recycles it back into the transpower systems. A switch on the panel closest to the door lowers the device to assist with regenerations by providing Artron Energy to the crew member.

A bed in the console roomThere is also an bed that can be extended out of the wall, for use when the Source is in operation. While active the lights will strobe and a high pitch screech will be heard. This piece of TARDIS technology is considered to be a vital part of regeneration for without this assistance regenerations are much more random and recovery takes much longer. It should be noted that excessive bursts of regeneration energy (say, caused by a the regeneration of Time Lord who had died of extreme radiation poisoning), can exceed the source's collection capabilities, and destroy the control room.

All TARDISes created after the Type 24 have more then one control room. These other control rooms all occupy the same space but each is located in different time phase. They can be reached by travelling through the TARDIS's pedestrian infrastructure, but for safety purposes, there's always about 2.4 to 4.8 miles of corridor between the Secondary (or Number 2 Control Room) and Primary Control Rooms. The Main Door can be shifted from one Control Room to another from any of the console rooms or from the outside using a TARDIS key.

NOTE: For information and pictures of the various console refits and how they can be customized, see the Desktop Themes in the Environmental Systems Chapter and the Refits and Upgrades Chapter.

### Primary Control Room

The Primary Control Room (or Number One Control Room) is designed for standard flights. It contains a more stylized Control Console, which is mostly automated. Later marks of these consoles have few advanced options. Indeed many versions lack even a Time Rotor. This lack of functionality has resulted in at least one Time Lord restoring his TARDIS to earlier Mark III specifications.

Like almost all TARDISes created after the Type 19, the Console is a free-standing hexagonal structure, The interior design of a control room (and the rest of the TARDIS) is decorated using Psychosculpture. The Psychosculputure is driven by device similar to a Chameleon Circuit - thus the interior has about as much possibility for variation as the exterior does. In the case of the Primary Control Room, the aesthetics of the operator often take precedence over functionality. This is expressed by users choice of Desktop Theme. In later refits this resulted in it being more difficult to control secondary systems from the Primary Control Room. The overall décor of the Primary Control Room is always fashioned to fit the whims of the Time Lord operator. Sometimes the console isn't even a hexagon. Despite this the lack of functionality offered in the primary control room

### Secondary Control Room

The Secondary Control Room (or Number Two Control Room) is a much simpler Block Transfer program than the more aesthetically oriented Primary Control Room. Since it is designed to function as something of a Safe Mode, the Secondary Control Room, desktop theme can't be altered from default. The casing of this Control Console is constructed of Pseudometal and only minor modifications can be made to its décor. The console can only be altered by upgrading to a higher Mark number. For Mark IV and later TARDIS refits the simplified controls of the Primary Control Room give limited access and control to several secondary[/unoff systems. The extra functionality resulted in many operators preferring Control Room Number two to the Primary one and viewing the Primary Control as being secondary. Some operators even chose to revert to a Mark III refit to avoid this problem (see Refits and Upgrades). Number two Control Room has six walls that are about 4.6 meters tall and is about nine meters in diameter. There is a large wall locker located to the left of the Main Doors. In the centre of the room is the Master Control Console. This hexagonal console has many technical capabilities that the Primary Control Room lacks. Located on the underside of this Control Console are the circuit breakers for all of a TARDIS's major systems and a silver switch that triggers a localized but powerful electromagnetic pulse. The supporting plinth contains a small storage locker.

### Tertiary Control Room

The Tertiary Control Room is found near the centre of a TARDIS's interior. It has a smaller Control Console with only four sides and a miniature Time Rotor. Some Tertiary Control rooms have green lighting and a console made of stone. This Control Room can generate its own exo-plasmic Shell and split off from the rest a TARDIS. In this form it can serve as a short term escape pod. When launched, it will home in on the "closest" habitable planet. It is also capable of locking onto and returning to its TARDIS if the operator wishes.

### Control Relay Rooms

In addition to the Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Control Rooms there are also several Control Relay Rooms which have consoles that look like smaller versions of the one found in the Secondary Control Room. If a severe trauma, such as a rupture of the dimensional interface, severs the operator's symbiotic link and disables the main control room one of these emergency console plinths will be generated in a randomly chosen storage room. The original architecture program will reboot once the symbiotic link is renewed. Given time, a TARDIS can rebuild/grow new Control Rooms to replace one that has been destroyed.

### Switch Room

The Switch Room is located in the Control Sphere directly beneath the Control Room. It routes signals from the Master Control Console to the rest of the TARDIS via transdimensional circuits and links. A hatch in the floor of the Control Room provides access to the Switch Room. The Artron energy stream from the Dynamorphic Generators travels through the middle of the Switch Room and connects with the Master Control Console's Heart (the Main Space-Time Element). From there it is released into the Vortex as counter-magnetization thrust which propels the TARDIS through the Vortex.

### The Navigator

While most TARDISes do have voice-interaction circuits that can control minor systems (for example the Main Doors) the Navigator represents a significant advancement. While the Type 46A's CPMI had been deemed a failure, the less ambitious Navigators voice control circuits found on the Type 70 and subsequent models used voice control circuits that allow the crew to operate a TARDIS using only vocal commands. Like the earlier voice-interaction circuits, the voice command systems have a voice lock so that only someone with the right voice print can operate the TARDIS.

When activated the TARDIS can implement almost any command, including complex flight instructions. The circuits will vocally confirm the completion of each action. Despite coming into existence well before the Time War most operators of that era found it quicker and more reliable to input commands directly into the console. But by the beginning of the Time War, voice interaction was much more popular on non-military TARDISes. The popularity was such that the control rooms were no longer designed for manual control. Optional controls were still available for use in an emergency.

### Dematerialization Procedures

Though there are 387 Stages to a TARDIS Vortex Flight, almost all of these are automatically handled by the infrastructure sub-systems. There are only 5 steps an operator must undertake to dematerialize a TARDIS from N-Space and initiate Vortex travel. Each of these steps has a progress light which illuminates when that step is completed. The process should not be taken lightly however because, if a dematerialization is performed improperly, there's a possibility of lesser species inside the Control Room being rendered unconscious. A warning lamp and buzzer will signal if one the demat-stages hasn't been completed correctly. Despite this, security procedures require that a TARDIS Information System does not contain any flight instructions.

#### 1. Programming of the Navigational Instruments

The current spatial coordinates (relative to Gallifrey's Eye of Harmony, at the centre of Mutter's Stellian Spiral) and the current temporal location (relative to Gallifrey's Present) are programmed into a TARDIS's Directional Unit/unoff] using the Navigational Slide Controls. These are usually the last set of coordinates used. If the Space-Time Coordinates of the current location have changed since the last materialization, then the new coordinates will have to be input. If the current coordinates are not precisely known, then an accurate course is impossible to plot. Once this is completed the Space-Time Coordinates of the desired destination (again relative to Gallifrey's Eye of Harmony and Gallifrey's present) are also programmed in (for more information see Navigation Slide Controls). If the operator desires, he can file a Forward Reference instead of setting the coordinates. This allows a TARDIS to dematerialize without setting any coordinates. In this case a TARDIS will remain in Limbo after dematerialization until coordinates are patched in.

#### 2. Computer Acceptance

The Directional Unit then uses the Space-Time Coordinates to calculate the Epsilon Coordinates, which serve as a path or a "road map" through the Space-Time Vortex. A TARDIS's computer usually does these calculations, but some Time Lords can compute Epsilon Coordinates in their heads. Calculating the Epsilon Coordinates is very complicated and requires good maths skills. The Input Bar is then depressed to feed the coordinates into the Course Acceptance Unit.

If the Input Bar is omitted, then a TARDIS will assume a Forward Reference has been filed. The vessel will dematerialize and remain in Limbo awaiting Epsilon Coordinates and other Flight Data. While multiple sets of coordinates can be input into the Directional Unit, any previous coordinates must be cancelled or the Unit will ignore the newly input coordinate program until it has completed the previous programmed flight. To ensure the coordinates aren't accidentally altered after being set, one of the twin navigational locks can be enabled. One locks manually input coordinates and the other is responsible for the Fast Return Switch.

Once the Epsilon Coordinates have been input, the course can be checked with the Destination Monitor. The full destination display uses the format shown below:

> TARDIS

> Flight Data. Programmed Journey

> Departure: [planet name] [location on planet]

>Local Dateline: [local date] [the era in Gallifreyan dating]

> Destination: [planet name] [location on planet]

>Local Dateline: [local date]  [the era in Gallifreyan dating]

#### 3. Power Build-up to required Levels

The Transit Switch needs to be toggled to activate the Vortex Primer, which provides the power boost for travel. It takes a TARDIS 12 minutes to build up enough power in the Time Rotor's Energy Storage Unit to dematerialize after materializing. The TARDIS drive systems can be tested to ensure the energy storage unit has enough power for successful dematerialization. The Booster Switches can be used to alter the default power levels. When the total power is reduced a TARDIS's trips through the Vortex take longer. Care must be taken (especially with older capsules) not to "over rev" in the third phase.

If the Transit Switch is not toggled a TARDIS will have insufficient power to travel more than a few hundred meters or seconds. If departing the planet the TARDIS would rematerialize a few seconds after it left. If departing a moving vehicle (such as a space craft) the TARDIS would materialize a few seconds later at its original spatial coordinates - likely being left behind by the vehicle.

#### 4. Dematerialization

The Master Dematerialization Switch can now be activated. This will engage the laser trigger of the Dematerialization Circuit and dematerialize a TARDIS. The Dematerialization Switch can be set on a time delay or remotely activated by a pre-determined signal from a portable device that is plugged in to the console when not in use. Some operators build this device into their sonic screwdrivers. If using a sonic screwdriver the operator must be careful lest he fuse coordinates in the Directional Unit.

The Molecular Dematerialization Codes are necessary to properly trigger the Dematerialization Circuit. They are essential to initiate successful travel in the Vortex. This is usually done automatically by the Symbiotic Relationship Circuit's Briode-Nebuliser, which pulls the codes from the operator's Rassilon Imprimature in the form of a Symbiotic Print.

If the sound of the dimensional stabilizers will be heard inside the TARDIS (as opposed to only outside). Dematerialization (a process that usually takes 3 seconds) can be aborted if the switch is reversed before the TARDIS has completely disappeared. However, care should be taken. Reversing the switch in the 3 seconds after dematerialization has been completed causes a Vortex Crisis (also see Time Ram). Creation of a Vortex Crisis is expressly forbidden by the Second Law of Time. The TARDIS will start to shake itself to pieces due to the massive forces forcing the capsule from one loop of the time spiral to the next. The re-materialization command must be cancelled to save the capsule. Once cancelled the TARDIS will initiate an Automatic Landing as soon as it is safe, materializing relatively near the dematerialization point.

For more information about see the Dematerialization entry in Navigation Systems.

#### 5. Vortex travel

While within the Vortex the TARDIS operates in Walrus Mode. The Spatial Drive will activate automatically when a TARDIS has entered the Space-Time Vortex. It is impossible (save using the Emergency Unit) to alter the coordinates once the ship has activated the Spatial Drive. The Brake can be used to temporarily deviate to an time zone. But the original course will have to be completed eventually. In theory, once the coordinates and course are programmed in, a TARDIS will travel to its destination and materialize automatically. In practice, Time Lord supervision is sometimes necessary to avoid dangers in the Space-Time Vortex. For example, collision with other objects in the Vortex is prevented using the Anti-Collision Control. An operator can monitor the consumption of this energy via the Neutronium Counter, which displays the power in
omegas. Once in the Vortex, a TARDIS requires a minimum of one quarter of full power (1000 omegas) to travel. The Velocity Override regulates the velocity when travelling through a wormhole. Travelling at minimum power greatly increases the ETA.

Travel through a Vortex wormhole can be displayed on the Scanner. A red tinted tunnel is displayed for travelling forwards in time and a blue tint indicates travel into the relative past. There are also two blue lights on the console that indicate forward or backwards time travel. These lights will register even if the TARDIS isn't responsible for the temporal shift.

For more information on this stage see the Space Time Vortex entry.

### Rematerialization Procedures

Though there are 387 Stages to a TARDIS Vortex Flight, almost all of these are automatically handled by the infrastructure sub-systems. There are only 5 steps an operator should undertake for rematerializing a TARDIS into the Multiverse. While the TARDIS Information System does not contain any flight instructions it does have detailed notes on the landing protocol.

#### 1. Synchronic Feedback Unit Activation

The Main Materialization Indicator begins to flash brighter and brighter one minute before Rematerialization. It will continue flashing until the materialization is complete. At this point the Synchronic Feedback Checking Circuit should be activated. This uses the gyroscopic stabilizer to orient a TARDIS relative to the nearest gravitational force to ensure that it does not arrive "upside down."

#### 2. Multi-Loop Stabilizer Activation

To prevent Materialization a few inches above the intended coordinates the Multi-Loop Stabilizer must be activated prior to landing. The Multi-Loop Stabilizer adjusts a TARDIS to land on a surface. The TARDIS can be put in a Parking-Orbit above a planet before materializing on its surface. If this is desired, then Hover Mode should be substituted for the Multi-loop Stabilizers.

#### 3. Release the Pause Control

Before re-materialization the brake (aka Pause Control) should be released. This prevents the sound of the dimensional stabilizers from being heard within the TARDIS. As it doesn't have any effect on the sound outside the capsule many Time Lords skip this step.

#### 4. Re-Materialization

Re-Materialization is the most dangerous part of Vortex flight. A TARDIS has an Automatic Landing Procedure for Materialization, but it is advisable for the operator to use manual materialization since even minor malfunctions in the Automatic Procedure could destroy the TARDIS by sending it outside the Time Spiral.

An indicator light will signal that Switch #1 can be toggled. Manual materialization can be enacted by toggling Materialization Switch #1, which extends the Dimensional Stabilizers into the Multiverse. A second light indicates that the operator can use Materialization Switch #2, which uses a materialization field to displace the atmosphere from the area and causes the dematerialization circuit to extend the Exo-Plasmic Shell into real space. After Materialization, a TARDIS's Artron Mainframe sends a very subtle telepathic signal to the crew to alert them to the fact that the ship has landed. A chime alert can be set to sound when Materialialization has been completed. There is also a small indicator light on the console that shows when the TARDIS has completed the materialization. Zeroing the co-ordinate differential automatic systems to reactivate the real world interface is the 387th and final stage in a TARDIS's space-time flight.

The operator should never initiate a Re-Materialization by deactivating the temporal stabilizer and pulling down the transitional element control rod. This would result in a TARDIS exiting the interstitial continuum at the perihelion of a temporal ellipse, which can induce buffering in the TARDIS's harmonic wave packet transference. In some cases it can even sever the main Fluid Links.

For more information on this stage see the entry Rematerialization in Navigation Systems

#### 5. Deactivate Drive Systems

After landing, power to the Time Rotor should be switched off by reversing the Rotor Control. The Transit Switch should also be toggled to power down the TARDIS's drive systems, and the navigational controls should be returned to their off positions. In Mark II and later upgrades the engines will automatically shut down as soon as the crew have departed this ship.

At this point is it standard procedure to consult the console's, Astrosextant Rectifier, and Digital Time/Place Orientation Readout to ensure the spatial and temporal coordinates are correct. The Scanner controls on the External Monitor Panel will allow the operator to verify the exterior levels of oxygen, atmospheric pressure, temperature, radiation and the like. It is also customary to use the Scanner screen for a visual overview.

### Astral Map

The Astral Map contains temporal, thirty-seven dimensional charts. It can access data from a TARDIS's Scanner, Astrosextant Rectifier, Time/Place Orientation Printout, Absolute Tesseractulator, Time Scanner, Emergency Transceiver, and Information Banks. This data can then presented to the operator.

Star systems are noted in simplified 4 digit coordinate systems (e.g. 0069 for Atrios/Zeos, 4180 for Cyrrenhis Minima, and 4940 for Ribos). More detailed coordinates are needed to actually visit a specific place or time in those systems.

These more detailed Space-Time Coordinates are calculated using advanced N-Dimensional Mathematics and are given relative to Galactic Zero Center (the Center of Mutter's Stellian Spiral). A TARDIS's Galactic Positioning System works using a time signature of Galactic Zero Center. This signature can be fine-tuned if (in addition to the current spatial coordinates) the relative locations of several Landmark Worlds are entered into the programmer. Such worlds include Gallifrey, Dagusa, Caresh, Erekan, Gau-Usu, and Cern. For this reason a TARDIS occasionally materializes in space to "get its bearings." Under such circumstances the journey can be continued by toggling one of the co-ordinator vector switch at the correct time.

Space-Time Coordinates consist of fifteen digits. While it may seem unlikely that a fifteen digit set of coordinates could precisely locate any point in space and time it should be noted the Gallifreyans might not have a base 10 counting system. The first two digits designate the Vector, the second two the Quadrant, the next seven digits represent the exact spatial location, and the last four digits represent the temporal location. These last digits advance steadily as a TARDIS "moves" forward in time. It should be noted that the Directional Unit doesn't do 'BC' and all dates will need to be positive.

Since the Astral Map is mounted on a control table with wheels, the data can be viewed any room in a TARDIS which is equipped with power outlets for the Map's time-space plugs. With long enough time-space links it is even possible to remove the Astral Map from a TARDIS. Data from the Astral Map can also be displayed on the Scanner screen.

Freak surges in the Vortex can create time spikes. While only a minor inconvenience for fully trained Time Lords, inexperienced operators can end up losing their TARDIS's Time Signature when they collide with the time spike. Without out the Signature the TARDIS wouldn't know where Galactic Zero Center is and it would be impossible to plot the rout-map home.

### Navigation Slide Controls (aka Space-Time Coordinate Programmer)

Also known as the Helmic Orientators, these slide controls (some consoles have a keyboard) and binary selectors are used by the operator for setting the Space-Time Coordinates. The coordinates must take into account the motion of objects relative to a TARDIS's current location, gravity's distortion of the Space-Time Vortex, and the exact time the operator wishes to travel to.

The Space-Time Coordinates are given relative to Galactic Zero Center (the Center of Mutter's Stellian Spiral). They consist of fifteen digits. While it may seem unlikely that a fifteen digit set of coordinates could precisely locate any point in space and time it should be noted the Gallifreyans might not have a base 10 counting system. The first two digits designate the Vector, the second two the Quadrant, the next seven digits represent the exact spatial location, and the last four digits represent the temporal location. These last digits advance steadily as a TARDIS "moves" forward in time. It should be noted that the Directional Unit doesn't do 'BC' and all dates will need to be positive. For more information see the entry Astral Map

Once the numerical sequence is known, setting the coordinates with the Slide Controls is a simple matter. The first eleven digits are input into the Geographical and Interstellar Destination controls. The remaining four are input into the Temporal Destination controls. In theory a fully functional and properly tuned TARDIS can be navigated to a temporal precision of a millisecond, and within a meter of a desired spatial location. As might be expected it is quite tricky to materialize on a ship in flight. The navigational systems can be set up to follow a program that was pre-set in the computer or stored on an external data source like a DVD. A timer can also be set to engaged the program if desired. If the TARDIS receives a signal from a Spatio-temporal Alarm Beacon then its triangulated coordinates can be used as the destination coordinates.

Care should always be taken when setting the coordinates. A hard impact to the navigational panel could knock the xion crystals out of alignment, causing the passivator to go into flux and leak green coolant into the aethiopathic chamber. Without coolant the positioning system will overheat and the thermal cut-out would trigger, preventing any space-time trips from being made. To ensure the coordinates aren't accidentally altered after being set, one of the twin navigational locks can be enabled. One locks manually input coordinates and the other is responsible for the Fast Return Switch. If the coordinates should become fused a TARDIS would only be able to travel between its current coordinates and the last time zone it visited. This would probably achieved by using the Fast Return Switch. If the coordinates are miss-set in such a way as to present the Directional Unit with an unsolvable equation a symbolic resonance could occur in the Trachoid Time Crystal, trapping a TARDIS in a fractal Zenos Paradox forever. Such a paradox would send a TARDIS into the cracks between dimensions and prevent the TARDIS from ever materializing. The TARDIS would remain trapped until the Vortex had eroded away everything except its foundational principles.

The operator should always avoid travelling back in time without first altering the spatial coordinates. If this is not done the TARDIS might materialize inside its younger self. The TARDIS will use the Cloister Bell to warn the operator if this is about to occur. It will also ring the bell if Coordinates are entered that would require the TARDIS to materialize inside solid matter.

All flight information is stored by the Banshee Circuits, which serve as a flight recorder. Proper maintenance is necessary to ensure accurate space-time jumps. If this maintenance is neglected for too long, the Programmer will wear out. For this reason it is recommended that an operator have their TARDIS's navigation systems recalibrated and serviced every 500 years.

### Directional Unit

The Directional Unit is part of the Main Time Mechanism. It takes the Space-Time Coordinates for departure and arrival and converts them into Epsilon Coordinates for travel through the Space-Time Vortex. For this reason it is essential to accurately know your current location to ensure a successful flight. The shorter the trip, the simpler it is to calculate the Epsilon Coordinates. Executing a short hop, however, has other difficulties. The resulting Epsilon Coordinates serve as a path through the Space-Time Vortex allowing a TARDIS to avoid any unknown regions or areas of intense time spillage. A fully functional and precisely tuned TARDIS is accurate to 1 millisecond and 1 meter. But in practice the Directional Unit is accurate down to about 3 meters or so. The "closer" a TARDIS is to Gallifrey's Time Zone (3.5 billion years ago and the centre of the Mutter's Stellian Spiral) the easier it is to navigate the Vortex. A TARDIS's computers require 12 minutes to re-orientate after materialization.

A fully functional Directional Unit is essential for precise navigation and landings. If the TARDIS hasn't been recently overhauled then the operator might need to changed the relativity unit before attempting a space-time jump. If this isn't done the TARDIS could end up temporally overshooting its intended time zone. A TARDIS that miss-jumps often finds itself at a Temporal Nexus Point (a time zone where history is easily changed). There are some locations that can only be reached by travelling through dangerous areas of the Vortex. Using Manual Override, a course can be plotted to these locations.

A directional unit from a Mark IV TARDIS Console requires more power than one installed on a Mark I. If a Mark IV Directional Unit is used on a Mark I Console it will burn itself out after one use to prevent the destruction of the central column. Even using the Fast Return Switch, a TARDIS with fused coordinates can only travel back and forth from its current location to its previous landing point. (with a leeway of about 18 months in either direction)

### Governing Circuit

This circuit is part of the TARDIS's Main Space-Time Element. TARDISes are built not to change history and this circuit is designed to prevent the operator from breaking the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Laws of Time. These protocols are not physical laws per se, but rather something built into the Governing Circuits of all Gallifreyan time travel technology.[/ref]

The Third Law of Time prevents anyone from travelling into Gallifrey's past, and ensure that a Time Lords personal time is always synchronized with Gallifrey's time. It also ensures that Time Lords will be synchronized when the meet outside of Gallifrey. In order for the Governing Circuit to function as it does, it's likely that TARDISes know significantly more about where they are going then their operator does. For example, they would need to know where other TARDIS and Time Lords have also travelled. To be effective, they would have to have the power to alter destination times to ensure that Time Lords never violate the Protocols of Linearity.

The Time Track Crossing Protection Protocol is a pre-set circuit that (in a normally functioning TARDIS) constantly prevents a TARDIS from crossing its own timestream by arriving before it left in the same general area. Due to the Blinovitch Limitation Effect, any time a TARDIS violates the 1st Law of Time by crossing its own time stream a large amount of chronal energy is released. This chronal energy can damage space-time. Some Type 40 TARDISes have faulty Protocol circuits that have unreliable connections, causing them to disengage and allow the TARDIS to break some of the Laws of Time.

Removal of the Relativity Differentiator will allow a TARDIS to travel into Gallifrey's distant past (before the Eye of Harmony), but it will prevent the TARDIS from changing its spatial coordinates relative to its current planet. The Temporal Limiter is also a key component of the Governing Circuit. A Temporal Limiter is required Vortex travel forward or backwards in time, and sabotage to it can effect the temporal aspect of a space-time jump.

It takes a major surge of power from the Prime Eye of Harmony to override this circuit (this must be authorized by the High Council). Despite this, a clever Time Lord will find these limitations easy to avoid. For example, the Time Track Crossing Protection Protocol can be overridden (though the operator then risks causing the TARDIS to vanish into a temporal nullity).

### Fast Return Switch

This device uses sequential regression to return a TARDIS to the approximate location and time of the previous landing site. Travel using the Fast Return Switch is considerably less energy intensive than most other flights. To operate this Fast Return Switch turn it in a clockwise direction. Earlier landing sites can be reached by depressing the switch multiple times. A stuck Fast Return Switch will force a TARDIS to travel back in time until it collides with, and is destroyed by, the formation of a galaxy or even the entire universe./tv] For this reason/unoff] some models of the Fast Return control have a crystal which flashes to indicate when it is in operation.

### Psycho-Telemeter

The Psycho-Telmeter use the psycho-telemetric circuit to allow a TARDIS to home in on the planet of origin of a given item. A genetic sampler can also use this system to feed Bio-Data into the Console allowing a TARDIS to track a specific strand of DNA or Vampire factor, through space and time.

### Pause Control (aka Time Rotor Hand Brake)

Before the Master Dematerialization Switch is engaged, the TARDIS can be put in Pause-Control mode. In this mode the TARDIS will refrain from dematerialization even after the switch is engaged. Dematerialization will proceed automatically as soon as the Pause-Control is cancelled The control can be cancelled by using the console to switch it off, or by inserting the TARDIS Key into the Locking Mechanism for 20 seconds.

If used during Vortex Flight it will suspend the TARDIS in Time and Space until released. Normally it is impossible to alter the coordinates once the ship has activated the Spatial Drive, but for Capsules using the Mark VII (or later) refits, the Pause Control and Emergency Dematerialization Switch can be used to temporarily deviate to a different time zone. This might occur during and Automatic Emergency Landing. A pause period will have to be set before the TARDIS can be diverted. Once the pause period has expired the TARDIS will automatically depart for the original destination.

If a TARDIS is trapped in mid-materialization for too long, the chronometric particles being released from the event horizon will cause the TARDIS to "bleed to death." However a Type 70 Model A TARDIS has an improved Pause Control that can freeze a TARDIS in mid-rematerialization for up to 2 microspans.

### Emergency Dematerialization Switch

If this switch is thrown, a TARDIS will dematerialize immediately. It will then wait in Limbo until the Epsilon Coordinates are input and the Transit Switch is thrown. Emergency Dematerializations bypass the Multi-Loop Stabilizer, resulting in "rougher" and noisier landings. They can also cause the lights to go out and might burn out the visual stabilizer circuit.

It is possible, but difficult, to alter a TARDIS's time curve (aka Wormhole) – and thus its temporal destination - whilst in the Vortex. This is done using first the Pause Control and then Emergency Dematerialization Switch during a programmed flight. This allows new coordinates to be input into the Directional Unit and thus change course. A pause period will have to be set before the TARDIS can be diverted. Once the pause period has expired the TARDIS will automatically depart for the original destination.

### Vortex Shields

These shields help to protect a TARDIS during Vortex travel. Without them the TARDIS will be vulnerable to any passing danger in the vortex. Despite the fact that the Vortex Shields interfere with telepathic communications between people who are in the ship and people who are in Normal Space, switching them off while in the Vortex is not recommended. If the Vortex Shields are overloaded the sub-neutron circuits will start to fail. With great difficulty Vortex Shields can be extended to imprison another Time Travel Capsule operating in the Vortex, however the shields can only hold the other capsule for 2 minutes. The TARDIS Defence Mechanism also acts to hide the TARDIS from potentially dangerous life forms that exist in the Vortex. The Exo-Shell has a Temporal Field, which protects its interior from temporal attacks. Vortex Wraiths would be destroyed by the TARDIS's defences if they attempted to invade the interior. (also see Defence Force-Field Prisms)

### Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)

Once a TARDIS has dematerialized and the Epsilon Coordinates are input the ETA will be displayed on the console. Since the Artron Mainframe usually calculates the Epsilon Coordinates, the Estimated Time of Arrival is based (in theory) on the space-time distance covered, and the efficiency of the Epsilon calculations. The TARDIS also uses data from the Mean Free Path Tracker to plot the ETA. A TARDIS travels forwards in time faster than backwards because it isn't fighting the flow of time and, in general, the larger the temporal jump the longer the flight. However because of difficulties in creating a safe path through the vortex physical distance has little affect on travel time. A trip of 1 mile often takes longer then crossing half the universe. While a TARDIS journey can take 9 weeks, in practice, it is rare for a trip to take longer then two days.

ETA also varies on the current state of agitation of the Vortex. Some operators claim the "mood" of the ship affects the ETA. This claim could have some basis in fact. Being four-dimensional beings TARDISes actually prefer travelling in the Vortex to inhabiting the Multiverse. However TARDISes have Curiosity Circuits. Without these circuits a TARDIS would never leave the Vortex. Despite all these variables, the displayed ETA will be accurate to within 5%. The materialization indicator will light up and begin to grow brighter and brighter during the last 60 seconds of a journey. It should be noted that the ETA display will not be updated if the TARDIS's course (and arrival time) is altered by some outside force. Regardless of a TARDIS' current position in the Vortex a flight to Gallifrey never takes more then 10-30 minutes. For example it takes 10 minutes to get to Gallifrey from 21st century Earth.

Using the Space Time Throttle it is possible for an Operator to control the effective "speed" of the TARDIS by altering the "length" of the route (and thus extend perceived travel time) through the Vortex. The Time Altimeter is used to monitor these changes in the "speed" of the TARDIS. When the total power is reduced a TARDIS's trips through the Vortex take longer.

### Helmic Regulator

A TARDIS leaves temporary wakes and time ripples in the Vortex during travel. To ensure safe travel the TARDIS uses the helmic regulator to set up the proper Boolean constraints to regulate the Planck-Collapse within the Vortex, and stabilize the chronon beam to avoid complete overload of the Time Spiral's polyhelixes on the macrotransablative level. While the regulator normally works automatically there is a manual control on the console which can override the navigational instruments. This control is quite sensitive and rotating it will change the timeship's course through the Vortex, sending it thousands of years off course.

### Absolute Tesseractulator

This device is responsible for keeping track of a TARDIS's dimensional location. It uses the Interstitial Antenna to collect data from the Vortex. A TARDIS knows where it's going by using digitally-modelled time-cone isometry parallel-bussed into the image translator, with local motion being mapped over every refresh-cycle. This information is displayed on the Gyro-Series Dials. It will detect time travel induced by exterior forces (even if the TARDIS's drive is not activated). It is possible that a TARDIS occasionally materializes in space to "get its bearings."

### Mean Free Path Tracker

Using data collected from the Interstitial Antenna, the Tracker uses the Heisenberg Focusing Device (also known as the Zig-Zag Plotter) to show a TARDIS's planned path through the Space-Time Vortex. It presents cosmic graphics that allow the operator to spot approaching turbulence in a TARDIS's flight path by displaying the position and direction of movement of temporal particlesoutside the TARDIS. When turbulence is expected it is recommend that the blue stabilizers be activated to preserve gravitational stability in the control room.

If the Time Lord wishes they can directly view the cosmic graphic of the wormhole outside the TARDIS using the Eyepiece which is set into the console. This is sometimes done in the case of scanner failure.

### Time-Path Detector (aka Time-Curve Indicator)

The Time Path Detector is found only in the Secondary Control Room. The Time Path Detector uses the Interstitial Antenna to collect data from the Vortex. With the aid of the Vector Tracker, the Time Path Detector can scan the time curve (aka wormhole) and track the position and course of other "nearby" Time Travel Capsules in the Vortex via their disturbances. It can also be used to track and follow other objects and vessels travelling in the same time track. (aka wormhole) It does not provide enough information to identify the type of timeship detected but can be used to predict the destination and ETA of the timeship. A quick transference jump can sometimes be used to lose anyone tracking a TARDIS.

The detector can allow the operator to detect the cross-tracing of another time ship on the timespace axis. If this occurs an emergency rematerialization can prevent the other timeships wash from destroying the TARDIS. Using this display as a guide, a TARDIS can be safely "pulled alongside" another Time Ship in its time curve. This will cause the Vortex shields of the two ships to begin jamming each other and eventually the sub-neutron circuits of one (or both) ships shields will fail.

The Time Path Detector is not available in Mark I TARDISes and other Vintage Capsules, but many operators construct and install their own. The Indicator can be removed from the console and used as a portable "alarm" to detect approaching Time Travel Capsules.

### Digital Time/Place Orientation Printout

Right before materialization a Temporal Probe determines the current year of destination. The resulting time print is displayed on what some operators refer to as the Yearometer screen when the time calculator button is pressed. Unless the voice integrator's text translation option is active, the readout is given in Absolute Time and a formula is needed to convert the date to Earth Time.

Right after materialization, the Astrosextant Rectifier will attempt to confirm that a TARDIS has arrived at the correct space-time coordinates. If the sky is visible, the Spectrum-Mixer can also be used to roughly determine the current spatial (and presumably temporal) location by analysing the position of nearby stars.

There can be significant delay in confirming the coordinates if the TARDIS is 'unsure' of the current time zone. The digits will be read out as precisely as the TARDIS Probe and Rectifier can determine. Information that can't be fixed will continue to fluctuate. If the current location is not know at all the readout will state "Location Unknown" in green text. Gallifrey (or maybe just the Death Zone) shows up as "no time" and "no place" on the TARDIS instruments. A reading of all zeros on the yearometer indicates that the TARDIS has jumped a time track..

A damaged Sterometer will reduce the accuracy of the Rectifier to within a few thousand light years. Similarly localized time friction can cause yearometer's safety device to reset to zero. But its built in memory will restore its function when the TARDIS leaves the time zone. A collision with an entity in the Vortex, such as the Mandragora Helix can thrown the Rectifier out of phase. Malfunctions can sometimes be compensated for by manipulating the time Tachograph.

### Jibbert Cathocode Troisieme Timepiece

This component is usually part of the Control Console. It records the passage of time aboard a TARDIS. When a TARDIS is near death the flow of time between the interior and exterior breaks down. The effect of this is similar to Temporal Orbit. In such cases several minutes will pass inside a TARDIS for every second that passes outside.

### Extreme Emergency Lever

If used by the Linked Time Lord Operator, this lever triggers the Distress-Call which sends an emergency All Frequencies Alert to the High Council of Gallifrey. This lever also serves a secondary purpose if the Symbiotically Linked Time Lord is drifting free in the Space/Time Vortex. Such action should be undertaken any time a TARDIS is captured by an advanced species. In such a case a TARDIS will use the time contours to automatically lock onto the linked Time Lord. Once this link has been established a crew member can pull the Extreme Emergency lever, and the TARDIS can rescue the Time Lord, materializing around him.

### Fail-Safe Switch

When the Locking Down Mechanism is activated, a TARDIS will seek out and lock on to the nearest habitable environment. This step will be omitted if the TARDIS is already materialized in such a location. Once locked on, Fail-safe prevents any dematerialization or materialization of a TARDIS until the switch is deactivated. Emergency doors will be generated in any areas of the TARDIS that (due to dimensional instabilities) have been cut off from the Main Doors in the Control Room. These doors will lead to the outside of a TARDIS and will appear integrated into the local environment. The existence of these doors will be unstable until the emergency bypass device is engaged.

Though it can be manually activated by the operator, the TARDIS will automatically initiate Fail-Safe if the TARDIS is about to break up (possibly due to a complete failure of the Main Space-Time Element while in the Vortex). Removing the Primary Refraction Tube from the Locking Down Mechanism prevents the Fail-safe setting from being changed.

### Emergency Emergency Systems

When activated, these systems generate a temporary transportation porthole, which has the appearance of a large orange ball of energy. This porthole transports anyone who passes through it to the "nearest" habitable environment. The system is completely random and crew members will often be sent to different planets (though they will all arrive at the same temporal coordinates). As there is no way to return to a TARDIS via the portholes, the device is only used when a TARDIS's destruction is imminent.

### Priority Deactivation Code

This is a code chosen by the Time Lord operator allowing him to forcibly deactivate (or reset) specific parts of a TARDIS. Some systems (such as the Banshee Circuits) are immune to this unless the Automatic Systems Override is activated.

### Automatic Systems Override

Actions that have a good chance of destroying a TARDIS or its crew are automatically prevented by the Banshee Circuits. However, all of a TARDISes automatic functions can be overridden, at the crew's own risk, using the Automatic Systems Override. This large switch is located behind a wall roundel near the Secondary Control Room. While manual override is enabled the operator will find the TARDIS easier to control if it is in hover mode. The operator should also avoid reversing the polarity of the neutron flow. Override mode significantly increases the chances of a miss-jump.

## TARDIS Drive Systems

Travel through space and time takes a fair bit of power. This section explains where a TARDIS gets its power from, and how it makes use of it.

### The Prime Eye of Harmony (aka Rassilon's Star, The Caldera, The Time-Sun)

Rassilon's Star was originally a Population III star named Qqaba. Rassilon and Omega used the Hand of Omega to turn this star into a rotating Black Hole. Using Amaranths, transdimensional physics, and Stasis-Halos, Rassilon brought the nucleus of the universe's first Black Hole to Gallifrey. The Eye was stabilized in an eternally dynamic equation against the mass of Gallifrey. This star became known as the Eye of Harmony because it sits outside History and watches the rest of the Universe. The Eye makes up the largest structure on Gallifrey - so large that it needs its own fold in space micro-universe
to contain it. This chamber is known as the Caldera and is located under the Panopticon (assembly hall) in the Capitol. Rassilon also created the ebonite rod known as the Rod of Rassilon (sometimes translated as "Great Key") which allows a Time Lord physical access to the Power Mast of the Eye of Harmony. The Caldera itself can be accessed via the Vaults found beneath the Capitol. The Security Codes needed to enter the Caldera change every microspan. If a lesser species was to enter the Caldera they would be killed. Indeed, due to density of strands in the Web of Time it is unhealthy for even a Time Lord to stand too close to the Eye.

Within the Event-Horizon of the black hole are a singularity and a universe of antimatter. Outside the Event-Horizon of the spinning star is an area called the Ergosphere. In this area energy that escapes the singularity's gravity is accelerated and amplified to almost infinite levels. Rassilon surrounded the Ergosphere with an iron sphere 10 kilometres in diameter. This sphere was mirrored on the inside. Rassilon allowed a light beam to enter the sphere. This light was amplified by the singularity's Ergosphere, reflected off the mirrored sphere, was amplified again, and so on. Each time the light beam gained energy. A small hole at the top of the sphere releases the amplified light beam. Using transdimensional physics, the Eye was shifted slightly into the future turning it inside out through the 5th dimension. This process is known as singularity eversion and it is done so that the near infinite power of the light beam emerges in a slow controllable osmotic stream. Without the Singularity Eversion the eye would turn into an exploding quasar.

After being converted into Artron Energy, the power is ready for use. Artron energy is measured in units called Omegas. This near magical use of super-radiant scattering allows the Eye of Harmony to provide energy for all of Gallifrey's needs (including time travel). The destabilization of the Eye of Harmony would cause Gallifrey to turn into antimatter, creating a quasar that would destroy a hundred worlds.

### Power Rooms

A TARDIS has a total of fifteen Power Rooms that contain all of the machinery that powers and operates the ship. They are located deep in a TARDIS's interior and serve as the "nerve centre" of the capsule. The following power rooms are known:

1. The Cloister Room
2. Power Stacks Room
3. Dynamorphic Power Station
4. Ancillary Power Station
5. Protyon Unit
6.  Life Support Systems
7.  Internal Scanner Room
8.  Fault Locator Room
9.  Primary Control Room
10.  Secondary Control Room
11. Tertiary Control Room

There are also several Control Relay Rooms which look like smaller versions of the Secondary Control Room.

### Cloister Room

The Cloister Power Room is the most important Power Room on a TARDIS, for it is here that a TARDIS's miniature copy of the Eye of Harmony is found. The room is located deep inside the TARDIS at bottom of the Transpower segment of the Time Sceptre. However there is a short cut from here that leads to Control Room #2. Artron energy from the Eye travels up the Time Sceptre's central shaft to the Transpower Systems and from there onwards to the Control Room Sphere. The Cloister Room of a TARDIS can take any appearance but it will always hold a TARDIS's Eye of Harmony. Most of them have what appears to be an open sky.

This room is the nexus point where all of the TARDIS's internal dimensions meet and are balanced. Because it is the equilibrium point for all of the vast forces of time, space, dimensions, matter, and antimatter this location is also known as Point Zero. A side effect of these forces is that the closer one gets to the Cloister Room, the stronger the dimensional "pressure" gets. This "pressure" can have minor effects on the nervous system.

Other devices found in this room include the Cloister Bell and special telepathic circuits, which are keyed to the biorhythms of the symbiotically linked Time Lord operator. These circuits can allow for some limited communication between the Time Lord operator and his TARDIS. The interior lights will be dimmed when a TARDIS communicates with its operator. These circuits can also act as an information retrieval system, and provide (through Temporal Projection) a direct audiovisual connection with the Time Lord operator. When used in this fashion it relays whatever the operator sees or hears to the Cloister Room. If a TARDIS "dies", the Cloister Room will be the last part of it that disintegrates.

### The Eye of Harmony Copy (aka Point Zero, the other Heart of the TARDIS)

One of the Hearts of a TARDIS (like Time Lords, a TARDIS has two) is a massive energy collector that is a mathematically constructed copy of the Prime Eye of Harmony on Gallifrey. In modern times it is often referred to as an Eye of Harmony (which can cause some confusion). Because of this, some Time Lords refer to it as Point Zero. These Eye copies can be found on all TARDISes after the Type 24. The Eye's iron-like Containment Sphere is located beneath the Cloister Room. While the Prime Eye's Containment Sphere is 10 km in diameter the TARDIS's sphere only about the size of a house.

Artron Energy created by the Prime Eye of Harmony on Gallifrey is broadcast into the Space-Time Vortex. This energy travels though the Vortex's Time Contours. Attached to a TARDIS's Containment Sphere is the Receptor Antenna, which collects artron energy using chronon transduction. The naked singularity at the Heart of a TARDIS is directly linked to the Space-Time Vortex, and uses Chronon Transduction to collect the energy.

This creates a link between a TARDIS's Eye and the Prime Eye on Gallifrey. The TARDIS's Heart then emits the beams of Artron Energy to power a TARDIS. The Eye is equipped with a Flux Comparator to ensure a steady flow of energy. The Eye also serves to slowly vent the potential energy stored from dematerialization. This Hawking Radiation is leaked from the Eye's event horizon. As long as the Prime Eye of Harmony on Gallifrey remains in existence, a TARDIS's energy source will never stop producing power.

This room, sometimes known as Point Zero, is the nexus point where all of the TARDIS's internal dimensions meet and are balanced. The closer one gets to the Heart of the TARDIS, the stronger the dimensional "pressure" gets. This "pressure" can have minor effects on the nervous system. If someone were to actually look directly into the Heart while it was transducting energy from the Prime Eye of Gallifrey their consciousness would be destroyed by the intense blasts of ArtronEnergy, leaving only a mindless body behind. Like the other Heart of the TARDIS (the Main Space-Time Element) the Eye can, under the right circumstances, restore the dead back to life. For more information see the entry on the Main Space-Time Element.

When a TARDIS is de-registered and made non-operational, the Eye is opened for a short time to de-energize it. Once de-energized, a TARDIS can only be reactivated using special Gallifreyan technology. Even with a plentiful fuel supply a drained TARDIS can't hold a charge and will need a "jump-started" to dematerialize. This is usually done by inserting a charged Neutron Rod into the receptor socket on the Console, but other power sources, such as a Time Ring' can also be used. Whatever the source, the power reading must be well above 0.2 omegas [ext]for a TARDIS to be energized. Even with a plentiful fuel supply a TARDIS can't hold the charge and will need a jump-start to dematerialize.

The Eye is protected from unauthorized tampering by a retina print lock that only allows Time Lords to open the Eye. This lock can only be changed by altering the Security Matrix on Gallifrey. If the Eye is opened outside of a Dry Dimension Dockyard, it will cut off the flow of Artron energy to the Dynamorphic Generators. Having the Eye of Harmony open alters the molecular structure of any nearby planets. The TARDIS will attempt to contain the Eye's energies, but if it is left open, the containment fields will drain all of the Auxiliary Power within three hours. At the end of this time any nearby planets will be destroyed in a massive burst of Gravitational Energy. If the Eye is left open for too long the TARDIS will die. Stasis Halos (similar to the Sash of Rassilon) should be used by the operator whenever working with an open Eye.

There is a switch labelled "Do not push" that will collapse an entire TARDIS into the Eye of Harmony. A Time Lord who is very close to their TARDIS can probably send telepathic messages to cause its Eye of Harmony to detonate in a massive explosion that would destroy everything for miles./ext] A TARDIS being destroyed in the Vortex might buckle causality in the Web of Time for centuries in either direction, and with the right technical knowledge and temporal abilities it would be possible to sabotage a TARDIS so that it would destroy the entire Universe. This would be done by allowing the temporal energy to burn simultaneously at every point in space and time. As the moment of total event collapse approaches cracks in the fabric of the universe would begin to appear throughout space and time. Anything exposed to the temporal power of these cracks would be erased from history becoming a never-person or never-object. Some of these cracks would be big enough to consume whole planets.

Since the Heart of the TARDIS is a copy of the Eye of Harmony, it can also serve as an temporary independent power source if the Prime Eye of Harmony is out of range (see Noosphere Parameters) or has been disabled. However the fuel supply of this Copy Eye is not unlimited. Given that the iron sphere that holds the Prime Eye is about 70 million times as big as the one holding a TARDIS's Eye it is possible that the Heart of a TARDIS has only 1/70,000,000 the fuel capacity of the Prime Eye. A fully fuelled TARDIS can travel at least 200 trillion years without completely exhausting the fuel supply. If specifically re-engineered, a TARDIS can just make it to the Universe's outermost planetoid, Hindmost. In any case, it appears that the Copy Eye is capable of supplying independent power for at least a few years.

Without the Prime Eye of Harmony a TARDIS would eventually have to refuel itself. A TARDIS can travel at least 22 billion years before refuelling. When necessary, the Eye's Receptor Antenna is also capable of collecting temporal energy from temporal instabilities, fault-lines running between dimensions, scars on reality, or rifts in time and space that found throughout this Universe. Time Rifts make the best fuel source. Such a rift occurs when two or more dimensions are pressed against each other creating a rift or a scar like an earthquake fault line. The TARDIS can drain off the energy created by the competing forces. Depending on the current energy level of the rift it can take a few minutes to a few days for the TARDIS to power up completely. The rift energy collected by the copy Eye is processed into Artron Energy to make it usable by the Transpower System. This energy is stored in the TARDIS's other Heart (aka Main Space-Time Element) located in the Console. A TARDIS's Emergency Procedures will automatically try to divert any large explosion or energy release that occurs inside the TARDIS into its Eye of Harmony.

It should be noted that if a TARDIS that relies on scavenged fuel (as opposed to the Eye of Harmony on Gallifrey) travels into another universe it would be left without power. Fuel collected in this Universe can only be used in this Universe. The TARDIS would be dead unless a source of Gallifreyan energy or a local source of rift energy could be found. If any of the TARDIS's small Power Cells retain power, they can be charged up if the operator donates a dose of artron energy equivalent to 10 years of their life. Once the cell has finished its recharging cycle (about 24 hours) and powered back up, it can be used to give the TARDIS five minutes to attempt a space-time jump.

Should power from the TARDIS's Heart be unavailable, the TARDIS will have to rely on the Ancillary Power Station for emergency energy.

### Amaranth

An Amaranth is a golden sphere about the size of a Cricket ball. It serves to stabilize the interior of a TARDIS from the de-rationalizing effects of the Eye of Harmony. It is capable of rebuilding small areas of the Universe along rational lines using its own very high Reality Quotient. If the Amaranth finds itself surrounded by a dangerous amount of irrationality, it will teleport its user to a safe location. The Amaranth (or similar technology) might also be used by the Chaotic Limiter in a War TARDIS to alter the reality quotient of time travellers.

### Transpower System

The artron energy from the Eye of Harmony travels from the Cloister Room up the shaft of the Time Sceptre, and enters the Transpower System. The system is lined with the transitional element Zyton-7 which processes the rift energy collected by the copy Eye to generate the Artron Orbital Energy.

This processed energy is routed through the Secondary Control Console's 2LO Energy Distributor Circuit (see illustration) and is stored in the TARDIS's other Heart (aka Main Space-Time Element) located in the Console. From here the Transpower System uses the internal power regulator and artronic resonators to monitor, reroute, and distribute this energy to the rest of the ship. The residue of the energy used by the Transpower System are vented into the Artron By-Product Waste Shaft.

The Power Stacks Room contains the power gauges and Power Response Display Dials that show the distribution of power by the Transpower System. Among other things, these dials show engine frequency (in cycles per second), engine temperature, and Time Rotor speed. In addition to these other devices, an artron energy capacitors is kept in the power room behind ruby coloured windows. If the TARDIS is properly configured then its symbiotically linked Time Lord can serve as medium to transmit vast amounts of artron energy. Such an action will likely kill the Time Lord.

The Transpower System is usually controlled and monitored with the 5 Booster Switches and the Power Response Display Dials in the Control Room. The most important of these is the main power switch. There are also several filter switches that can be engaged to reduce the risk of overloads.

The power used by the Dynamorphic Generators during Vortex travel should not exceed 1000 omegas. Otherwise a TARDIS will begin draining the Ancillary Power Systems and possibly vaporize the mercury in the fluid links. The amount of power necessary to enter and travel through time is dependent on the size of the object being transported. A full sized TARDIS requires a steady output of several hundredomegas to travel in the Vortex, but if only the console is flying a mere 500 watts is sufficient. If the TARDIS diverts all power to its drive systems it will be unable to activate is defence mechanisms. It would then be possible for intruders to breach the main doors.

Magnetic fields cause fluctuations in Artron energy. Strong telepathic signals may interfere with the flow of Artron Energy within a TARDIS and cause all sorts of malfunctions. Attack by a massively powerful telepathic force can cause the Relative Continuum Stabilizer to fail. Failure of the 2LO Circuit will not only prevent travel but stop a TARDIS's lighting, heating, and food dispenser from working. A red light indicates failure of main power.

### Zyton-7 (aka Zeiton-7)

Zyton-7 is a crystalline mineral that is essential to the operation of a TARDIS's Transpower Systems. The mineral is found naturally only on the planet Varos which is located between the Constellation/Galaxy of Cetes. It can also be synthesized artificially using compressed nitrogen as the base, but the formula is complex. Zyton-7 has the extremely rare capability to transform the Eye of Harmony's energy into orbital artron energy. Similarly Zyton 7 also shifts and amplifies an organic mind's artron energy into a form of energy that can have a physical effect on a that being over time. Extensive exposure to this energy will alter a person's morphic field.

The shape and nature of every lifeform in the universe is influenced by the morphic field of that species. The Artron Energy created by a living being creates the morphic field as a sort of collective psionic aura which acts as a species equivalent to an individual's biodata. The longer a particular species has been around the stronger its morphic field. These fields build up over several generations.

Continual exposure to Zyton-7, will alter a being's morphic field, causing its biological nature to change. The subject's own body will begin to metamorphose to reflect their subconscious desires and insecurities. Such manipulation requires a living organic mind capable of adapting to the irrational changes caused by the alterations. Ideas and concepts that are strongly believed in can become real. It is the radical amplification of this effect that allows the conceptual base mutations caused by a Cell Mutator. For this reason, Zyton 7 should be handled with care.

Zyton-7 lines the Transitional Elements allowing them to generate Orbital Energy for Vortex travel. High quality Zeiton 7 allows a TARDIS to boost its 'thrust.' The Orbital Energy's ability to alter morphogenic fields is essential part of TARDIS travel. While a TARDIS's transportation of its crew through time and space is usually described as a "Journey" it is just as accurate to say that a TARDIS actually works by recording is crew's biodata and reprocessing/manipulating their future to take into account a different location in space and time.

A standard supply of Zyton-7 usually lasts for centuries. A TARDIS will need to be recalibrated after new Zyton 7 is installed. This recalibration involves verifying the current space-time coordinates of the TARDIS, and can take if hours if most of the TARDIS systems haven't been maintained. If maintenance is neglected, the transitional elements lose their capacity to generate orbital energy and the TARDIS will stall in the Vortex, possibly trapping the crew forever.

### Artron Energy

Artron energy is both technological and barely distinguishable from Time Lord Biology. Artron energy per unit time is measured in units called Omegas. A common rat can generate one trillionth of a yocto-Omega (1 * 10^-24 omegas) of Artron Energy. Artron Energy can be maser-modulated into thermal energy. When converted, the equivalent thermal energy is enough to instantly kill a cat. From this it can be determined that one Omega equals (within an order of magnitude) about 3x10^46 watts. Artron Energy's crystallizing abilities could make it a kind of anti-entropy. The White Guardian is the Guardian of order and structure. Given how Artron Energy crystallizes history it is possible that Artron Energy is connected to him in some way.

Since it is resistant to the effects of the Space-Time Vortex, it is the primary energy used in TARDISes. It is essential to the operation of the TARDIS. Because of this a TARDIS generates a low intensity telepathic field. The power necessary for a TARDIS to make a trip through time is many orders of magnitude more then that of a star. For comparison, Earth's sun puts out 4 * 10^26 watts.

All Time Lords possess at least a quantum of Artron Energy due to their genetic structure, but because of this shared artron field, a symbiotically linked Time Lord's artron energy levels are greatly elevated. During Vortex travel the DNA of crew members will be lightly irradiated with Artron Energy from the universe's background chronon radiation. For this reason travelling in a TARDIS has significant effects on the brain of any lesser species. The radiation incrementally increases the amount of artron energy they possess. Aside from providing greater reserves for certain telepathic situations there are no side effects from this irradiation. Although it will continue to accumulate and never fade, it will never reach dangerous levels. These effects will show up very plainly in certain types of very advanced brain scans and the effect can be used to date the exposure.

Since Artron Energy is used by both TARDISes and Gallifreyans, a TARDIS can use its power to help a Time Lord regenerate. However, if a Time Lord's exposure is too great, he must die or regenerate within a day. A Gallifreyan can save an irradiated victim by absorbing the energy from their body into his own. After doing this a regeneration will be necessary to get rid of the excess energy. If the TARDIS is properly configured, its linked Time Lord can serve as medium to transmit vast amounts of artron energy (though this will likely kill the Time Lord). Artron energy flows in a TARDIS can be disrupted by some types of magnetic field and lead shielding.

### Complete Systems Shutdown

Standard Systems Shutdown is enacted using a lever found on the Console. When used it deactivates almost every system and circuit (including most of the life support systems). Only the peripheral reserves will be accessible while in this state. Complete Systems Shutdown involves folding back the omega configuration, halting the exponential cross-field, closing the pathways to conditional states seven to seventeen and ending the Main and Auxiliary Drives.

### Main Space Time Element (aka The Heart of the TARDIS)

This power source appears to be a fist-sized block of circuitry with a red fluid filled cylinder attached. It is considered to be one of the "Hearts" of a TARDIS (like a Time Lord, a TARDIS has two). The fluid filled cylinder attached to the heart is the main cut-out stack which acts as a control on the space-time element. The Element is located inside the console in the Control Room. (The other Heart is the copy of the Eye of Harmony, which is located deep beneath the console - at the other end of the Time Sceptre). Orbital Artron Energy from the Transpower System is stored in the Main Space Time Element (aka the Heart). The energy in the TARDIS's Heart is the soul of the TARDIS. The Heart of the TARDIS also contains Huon particles.

The Time Lords invented Huon Energy for their time travel technology. Huon Particles need something living (like a TARDIS) to catalyse inside. Catalyzed Huon Particles magnetize to other Huon Particles drawing them across Time and Space. They also turn the Dynamorphic Generator's energetic muons into counter-magnetization thrust. When inert, Huon Particles are safe, but if given a chance to catalyse in a sentient being, they become deadly. Billions of years ago the Time Lords wiped out virtually all Huon Particles (outside of their TARDISes) and Fluon Radiation in the cosmos by unravelling their atomic structure. Fluon Radiation can be used to amplify and purify Artron Energy. It is possible that Huon Particles generate Fluon Radiation. The energy of the Heart can also be used to neutralize anti-time.

Using the magnetism of Huon Particles the energetic muons created by the Dynamorphic Generators are accelerated into counter magnetization thrust. This energy is released through the Heart's space-time portal into the Vortex to push the TARDIS through the 5th Dimension. This makes the Space-Time Element is an essential component for Vortex travel.

The Recall Circuit is part of the Main Space-Time Element. Remote operation of a TARDIS drastically reduces the life span of its Space-Time Element. This problem can only be solved with a Stattenheim Remote Teleport Control. A replacement Element must be coded to match the specific Type of the TARDIS's Time Rotor.

Exposed circuitry where the main time-space element should beEven a minor temporary glitch in the Heart will trigger an Emergency Materialization. When a TARDIS has materialized, the Element is easily removed, but removal in flight requires deactivating several safety systems in the corridor outside the Secondary Control Room. If the Element's cut-out is even partially detached while in flight the Time Column will jam (possibly causing the TARDIS to leave the Time Spiral) and the internal dimensions will start to destabilize. If this should happen the operator should immediately activate the safety cut-out or a TARDIS will begin to break up from Armageddon Dimensional instability. Repairing a partially detached cut-out is a time consuming process. If a breach were to occur in the force fields surrounding the Heart (say if the Time Column came all the way out of the console), the released energy would be enough to blast an unprotected person to atoms in seconds.

If one gazes into the heart (without first activating the safety systems) one sees not only the Heart of the TARDIS, but also the Space-Time Vortex. The TARDIS will be able to directly understand the viewer's thoughts and emotions by converting them into the language of Time itself. It is the only way for a being to have complete rapport with the soul of a TARDIS. The energy of the Vortex would give the viewer power over Time, Space, and the Vortex. They would be able to use the Power of Creation to alter all of History with a thought. Ideas and concepts that are strongly believed in can spontaneously become real through the use of orbital energy. A single being (or
even an entire species) can have its biological nature instantly changed by altering its morphic field. This has been referred to as the Bad Wolf Scenario.

The shape and nature of every lifeform in the universe is influenced by the morphic field of that species. The Artron Energy created by a living being creates the morphic field as a sort of collective psionic aura which acts as a species equivalent to an individual's biodata. The longer a particular species has been around the stronger its morphic field. These fields build up over several generations (probably as a side effect of the crystallization of history caused by observation).

Such manipulation requires a living organic mind capable of adapting to the irrational changes caused by the alterations. If the viewer was not equipped with symbiotic nuclei they would become one with the Vortex - a dimension of pure thought with a complexity that borders on sentience. They would be under the direct control of the Vortex. If a Time Lord absorbed the power they would become a vengeful god.

Unfortunately it is also incredibly dangerous to look into the Heart. Every time the TARDIS 'speaks' to the viewer it runs the risk of altering the subject's biodata, possibly reversing the ageing of a viewer, turning an adult into an infant. The viewer will also be exposed to all the artron energy flowing through the Heart and into the Vortex - irradiating them with a lethal amount of energy. A Time Lord can funnel most of this radiation back into the TARDIS and burn up the rest with a regeneration. However a member of a lesser species would find themselves slowly dying. But the danger goes beyond that of the individual. Because morphic fields don't follow the normal laws of space and time such changes are difficult to control or limit. Ripples can be generated that would randomly effect species in different star systems. If the field is strong enough it will influence the evolution of other life forms, even species who are thousands of light years away.

A TARDIS can "catch" anyone who dies by entangling their time stream within time fields created by the Heart of the TARDIS. Using morphic fields, this allows a TARDIS to bring those who die back to life. By manipulating the victim's morphic field they can be fixed or locked down at a specific point in time before they died. There are several ways this can happen. The most likely situation occurs when a TARDIS is accidentally positioned obliquely between two irrational time interfaces. It can also occur if the TARDIS systems are pre-set properly (though this would constitute a violation of the Laws of Time). A third possibility requires someone to gaze into the Vortex in the Heart of the TARDIS (aka the Space-Time Element) gaining power over Space and Time.

People resurrected using the power from the Heart of the TARDIS are effectively immortal. If killed by, say a bullet to the brain, they will quickly recover. They can never stay dead because their physical being is anchored into history itself. They might also be able to heal others. Because they are fixed in time they are seen as an obscene violation of the Laws of Time such that it takes a significant effort of will for either a TARDIS or a Time Lord to knowingly interact with such a person.

The Main Fluid Links are made up of glass tubes filled with mercury. Mercury is an element that can serve as an interface between the forces of thought and energy. Since Artron Energy is the energy of thought, the mercury in the links acts as a "fuse" to transfer power to the Dematerialization Circuit. All early model Capsules suffered from frequent failures of their fluid links. If the drive systems receive over 1000 omegas of power for more then a few seconds there is a good chance the Fluid Links will overload and release vaporized mercury into the control room. Sometimes these overloads required replacement of the entire link. The Links are located in the base of the console in the Secondary Control Room and can refilled by pouring mercury into the appropriate port on the console. The fluid links require ten millilitres of mercury to function. In addition to refilling the Links, after an overload the operator will have to repair several other systems (located in the Power Stacks Room). This problem was rectified with the Type 60 and later models.

### Dematerialization Circuit

This is the device responsible for shifting a TARDIS into and out of the Vortex. The Molecular Dematerialization Codes are needed to activate the laser trigger found inside the circuit. The Symbiotic Relationship Circuits automatically input these codes if the operator is a Time Lord. Minor errors in the code will probably result in poor accuracy in navigation. If the TARDIS is equipped with a symbiotic bypass it is relatively simple to bypass the codes and activate the laser trigger using a Light Accelerator. Once the circuit is activated Dematerialization begins.

Components of the circuit include a laser trigger, macromat field integrator, directional memory wafers, and stabilizing dio-nodes connected to transceiving telo-circuits. The Dematerialization casing is attached to artron filaments using a steady-state micro-welding technique, first pioneered by the Lamadines. In an emergency a properly engineered piece of quartz can be used to replace a burned out macromat field integrator. On the Mark I Console, the dematerialization Circuit is located beneath the Main Door Control.

A Demat Circuit can be used as a dematerialization booster to separate two ships that have suffered a hyperspace collision - though this has only a 60% chance of success. With the right technical knowledge it is possible to convert a Demat Circuit into a temporal bomb that would spread a TARDIS across 1000 years of time - destroying any solar system that happens to occupy that time zone. A circuit fitted with a Dematerialization Cut-Out or a Return Circuit might be more susceptible to this sabotage. It should be noted that a dematerialization circuit designed for a Mark II console won't work with a Mark I console and vice versa. It would be necessary to upgrade the entire TARDIS console to make a newer circuit compatible.

### Dynamorphic Power Station

This is the location of the Dynamorphic Generators. The Power Station is a chamber with a mile-high ceiling and no discernible walls. The room is filled with millions of Trachoid Time Crystals, each one a few meters from the next. They look like thick green crystal columns that reach the ceiling. The control system consists of machinery with buttons, lights and meters. Power is supplied to the Generators via the Dynamorphic Relays. The Dynamorphic Generators use revolution-induced gravity to convert the Artron Energy into energetic Muons, which provide counter-magnetization Thrust for travel in the Space-Time Vortex.

An operator can monitor the consumption of this energy via the Neutronium Counter, which displays the power in omegas. Once in the Vortex, a TARDIS requires a minimum of one quarter of full power (1000 omegas) to travel. Travelling at minimum power greatly increases the ETA. Due to the Protocols of Linearity it requires much more power for a TARDIS to return to a point in time right after it left if a large amount of time has passed for the TARDIS since it last visited that time zone. If the TARDIS diverts all power to its drive systems it will be unable to activate is defence mechanisms. It would then be possible for intruders to breach the main doors. Located in the Dynamorphic Power Station is an Emergency Door that leads out of the dimensional gateway (see Main Doors). This Dimensional Gateway is located on the opposite side of the Exo-Plasmic Shell to the main Gateway.

The Generators can't handle more than 1000 omegas for more than a few seconds. If the Generators are being overloaded then the operator can use the Engine Release Lever to try to regain control. Alternatively the engines shut down automatically whenever the entire crew departs the ship. If that fails, then as a last resort, the Time Vector Generator can be physically removed to prevent major damage. The ringing of the Cloister Bell can indicate that the engines are phasing. Under such circumstances the operator should make a micro-jump 5 minutes forward in time. This will allow the Dynomorphic Regenerator to stabilize the engines.

The magnetic containment systems of the Dynamorphic Generators continuously discharge temporal plasma fields in a wave-loop pattern. When the main drive on a Type 40 is active the orthogonal readings of the Hyper Time Ratio should be ZS+ 101 EQ. Because later models of TARDIS have larger shift ratios in the wave loops, its possible to identify the specific Type at a distance by analysing the ratios. The same identification can be carried out by checking the molecular patina of its Shell.

Dynomorphic generators can be exhausted, requiring them to be replaced. In an emergency it is possible to use less sophisticated materials to replace the green crystals - this would result in TT Capsule that was more like a Space Inter-Time Dimensional Robot All-purpose Transport (SIDRAT) than a standard TARDIS. When running in a TARDIS with a new Dynomorphic Generator, the operator should navigate an already established vortex wormhole (such as a Time Contour or a Time Corridor) to check out the temporal dimensions. This is a good way of testing the engines on low power as it requires less energy.

### Power Stacks Room (aka Power Room #5)

The Power Stacks Room contains the power gauges that show the distribution of power by the Transpower System. Located in the Dynamorphic Power Station is an Emergency Door that leads out of the dimensional gateway. This Dimensional Gateway is located on the opposite side of the Exo-Plasmic Shell as the main Gateway.

### Time Column (aka Time Rotor)

Time Columns are found in the Secondary and Tertiary Control Rooms. Many (but not all) Primary Control Rooms are also equipped with them. The central Time Column is made of glass and contains a crystalline assembly made up of multiple motors and rotors, including the Time Rotor, the Energy Storage Unit, Codium Links, Conceptual Geometer Relay, and navigational instruments. All Type 97 TARDISes have their Time Vector Generator installed in the central column. For this reason the Type 97 column looks very different than the one found on a Mark I Console. Indeed each Type of TARDIS has a unique Type of Time Rotor that must be matched with the Main Space-Time Element to ensure proper operation.

Codium Links are found in the heart of a Time Rotor. They can be used to compress dark matter like WIMPs (Weakly interacting Massive Particles). The Conceptual Geometer probably measures imaginary spaces and might be necessary to travel through Time (but not space) in the Vortex. It must be deactivated before major modifications are made to the TARDIS. The Geometer is equipped with an agronomic trigger and field separator. The Conceptual Geometer can be found near the Ancillary Power Station and its Relay is found inside the Time Column. The base of the rotor's pedestal is connected to the Sonic Booster. The interior of the Time Column pressurized a transparent gas that turns white when exposed to a G Type environment. Should the glass of the column be breached this gas will escape into the control room. While not dangerous to Gallifreyans the gas is toxic to humans.

The power necessary for a TARDIS to make complete a trip through time is many orders of magnitude more then that of a star (the Earth's sun has an output of 4x1026 watts). Because of its immense power requirements the Time Column is located directly over one of the Hearts of the TARDIS - the Main Space Time Element. Thus the Rotor provides access to the richest source of temporal energy on a TARDIS. The Rotor holds the power of the Heart of the TARDIS in check by "weighing it down" to prevent its escape. In this way it controls the power of the counter-magnetization thrusts emitted by the Space Time Element. Each space-time jump drains the Time Rotor's Energy Storage Unit to the point where it can only travel a few seconds into the future. It takes a TARDIS 12 minutes to charge the Energy Storage Unit with Temporal Energy for another space-time jump. This is done using the Temporal Reactors fuelled by Artron Energy. The Temporal Reactors are filled with chronoplasmic energy, which is contained by Zybanium shields.

The Time Rotor has a progress display on the console. Using this, the drive systems can be tested to ensure that the time rotor is primed for dematerialization. During flight the Time Rotor rises and falls in time with the cycling of the Dimensional Stabilizers. The time rotor pulses with artron energy during Vortex travel. When it lowers, it performs a complete scan of all TARDIS power "thrust" systems. When it rises it provides the operator with a status report on the time changes of these systems and indicates the amount of the power-thrust delivered. The frequency of its cycling slows as a TARDIS prepares to materialize. The Column can only move when the power to the drive systems is on. When fully materialized the column will be retracted and unlit. But if a TARDIS is in hover mode the rotor will continue to glow. The central column appears not to oscillate when travelling through Inner Time (such as on Gallifrey). When some types of 5-dimensional Scanning Modes are enabled, the Time Rotor will rotate within the Column, presenting the operator with an approximation of the ship's current space-time coordinates.

If the Time Column was to stop moving while in the Vortex the TARDIS could fly right through the Time Spiral. The column holds the power down and prevents it from escaping. But this restraint could be overridden with a magnetic field if it was as strong as the fields of an entire solar system combined. It would take 5 minutes for such a field to pull the Time Column all the way out of a Console, releasing the power from the Heart of the TARDIS. The escaping Artron Energy from would flood a TARDIS, and the crew would be blown to atoms in seconds.

To remove the TARDIS Locking Mechanism while in flight, the Time Rotor must be disconnected. This is necessary to override the fail-safes designed to prevent tampering with the lock while in the Vortex. Care should be taken when removing the protective Column from the Rotor. Contamination of the Time Rotor by psychic pollen can lead the crew to experience severe telepathic hallucinations caused by the symbiotically linked Time Lord's unconscious. In such a case the Dark Side of the Time Lord's mind might rise above his normal repression to inflict damage.

### Emergency Power Booster

This small red box contains the maximum power-drive switch. When plugged into the console and activated it diverts all of the Eye of Harmony and Ancillary power to the Dynamorphic Generators in a massive surge. This is a dangerous device to use, as the Generators will overload if they receive more than 1000 omegas for longer than a few seconds. This could cause the mercury in the Fluid Links to vaporize, and will lead to the eventual destruction of a TARDIS. If the TARDIS diverts all power to its drive systems it will be unable to activate is defence mechanisms. It would then be possible for intruders to breach the main doors. For these reasons the Power Booster is not usually plugged into the console.

### Power Outlet Socket

The power outlet sockets are located beneath the Power Monitor Panel on the Console. They can instantly adapt to the power needs of any apparatus requiring energy. Power from the TARDIS can be used to recharge some types of space ships. This takes 3-4 hours.

## TARDIS Environmental Systems

The TARDIS is not just a vehicle for travelling through time and space, but is also an entire living environment. This section describes the systems which create and maintain this environment.

### Dimensional Transcendence

Properly speaking TARDISes are best described as "spaces," rather than "objects." Most TARDISes are Dimensionally Transcendental, meaning that they are bigger on the inside than the outside. This effect is achieved by making a TARDIS's interior a quasi-dimensional continuum located outside of Time in a different dimension then the exterior. This Micro-Universe is created using Transcendental Block-Transfer Equations that don't interface with Normal Space in a traditional way. A Time Lord can tell when one is in a dimensionally transcendental chamber by looking for a slight warping on the edge of his field of vision. Crew members will find that for every month they spend inside a TARDIS they will age slightly less then a week.

Dimensional Transcendentalism is achieved using the Relative Dimensional Stabilizer, which time maps the para-dimensional interior though null-space and the Vortex and onto the Exo-Shell's exterior outlet. This Time Mapping forms the Dimensional Gateway. The dimensionally transcendental nature of a TARDIS can be thought of as a hypercube (i.e. a 4 dimensional square).

A TARDIS's interior is composed of a complex web of bio-mathematics and exitonics with a finite multi-dimensional mass, which usually totals about 68 thousand metric tonnes. The size can be altered using the dimension scale control on the console. While a TARDIS's minimum interior volume is about the size of an atom, its maximum volume is about one trillion cubic kilometres

The interior of a TARDIS is incapable of holding an object that is several miles across without extensive block-transfer modifications. In such a state one could walk for 10,000 years with only a few hours of rest a day and never reach the end. The great size of a TARDIS interior is also rumoured to be linked to the vast depths and capabilities of a Time Lord's mind.

During the Time War the matter used for the internal structure of a TARDIS can withstand a full-on thermonuclear blast. It is theoretically impossible for there to be a breach between the TARDIS's micro-universe and the Vortex. This is because the Internal Dimensional Units act to prevent internal trans-dimensional breaches. Nevertheless such breaches have been known to occur under extreme circumstances, and there is a high-pitched alarm designed to alert the crew if the structural integrity has been breached. While a TARDIS interior can't be breached by a Vortex Infarction or a Time Scoop, it is possible for a charged vacuum embodiment to cause a wormhole that could penetrate the interior. Such a breach in the endo-shell of a TARDIS could (among other things) allow all the air to leak out.

### Time Vector Generator (aka Dimensional Control Unit, External Integrity Stabilizer)

The Time Vector Generator (TVG) is an 18 inch long black rod with gold and white caps. It connects the Exo-Plasmic Shell with the interior Micro-Universe. The caps at either end of the Time Vector Generator can be removed to release the vast amount of power stored in the Time Vector Generator. It will release a dazzling light and burst of radio static (enough to burn out advanced communication gear). This power could be adapted to be used by primitive technologies. In a Mark I TARDIS the Generator can be found behind one of the roundels in the secondary control room. In Mark IV console the dimensional control can be found on the underside of the console. In a Type 97 the Time Vector Generator installed in the central column, giving it a very different appearance from the column found on a Mark I.

Removal of the Time Vector Generator collapses a TARDIS's interior, making it the same size on the inside as the outside. Such a removal would cut all power to the Dynamorphic Generators. If the Time Vector Generator is removed for too long the TARDIS will suffer severe damage. If reinstalled, the interior of a TARDIS will quickly "re-grow," but the internal configurations are sometimes scrambled and redecorated.

A malfunctioning Time Vector Generator can allow time warp fields to leak out of the console, possibly displacing the operator forward in time. Malfunction of the Fluid Links can render the Time Vector Generator inoperative. Faced with attacking Reapers a TARDIS will separate its Exo-Shell from the interior universe to protect itself. This is done by disconnecting the Time Vector Generator. It should be noted that there is no spare Time Vector Generator, nor can one be constructed (in a reasonable time) in the Workshop. Adapting the emergency one used by the Tertiary Control Room is impossible.

### Relative Dimensional Stabilizer

The primary and secondary Relative Trans-Dimensional Stabilizers (RDS) are inside the control assemblies of their respective Control Rooms. They are accessed from the underside of the console. They are responsible for creating the size, shape and form of a TARDIS's interior. The sphere of the Core Service Module is surrounded by a grid of matter control projectors which the Dimensional Stabilizers use to maintain the Module. Because they allow the operator to cross three dimensional barriers a TARDIS cannot travel the vortex without them. The field created by the stabilizers are also an essential part of the Temporal Grace effect. Because of their role as an interface between the four dimensional TARDIS and its three dimensional crew the Relative Dimensional Stabilizers[/ext are essential for the TARDIS to understand the desire of its operator.

Monitoring and controlling the RDS takes up more of the Artron Mainframe's processing power than any other function, leaving only 5% of the processing capacity for other functions. Vintage Mark I consoles have very primitive Stabilizers in comparison to later models. While the Primary RDS can handle normal operations when the TARDIS is fully materialized the secondary stabilizers can be cored in to operation if the operator desires.

The Relative Dimensional Stabilizers cycle continuously when a TARDIS is in flight and can sometimes be faintly heard in the Control Room. The sound is clearly audible on the exterior when a TARDIS materializes or dematerializes. This sound is slightly different for different types of TARDIS. If the TARDIS is badly in need of an overhaul the Dimensional Stabilizers will be unbalanced and sound different almost every time there is a materialization.

The Dimensional Stabilizers can be used to fix some kinds of space-time anomalies. They can seal cracks in Time that lead to Parallel Universes, repair damage to the time lines, and act as temporal de-crystallizers It should be noted that the TARDIS's exo-shell can also be used to temporarily plug some types of holes in space-time. In an emergency (and using codes available only to the Lord President) the Stabilizer can be used to control Gallifrey's defence barriers.

Like many pieces of Time Lord technology, the stabilizers will interface with alien technology automatically. The stabilizer can use sonic vibrations at specific frequencies to alter the space between atoms – effectively altering the size of people or objects with only a few simple modifications. The possible compression factor can be up to a million or possibly even higher. The Relative Dimensional Stabilizer's generator appears to be able to bank matter (or at least mass and inertia) in some sort of a holding account. The result is that even though the number of atoms remains the same the mass and inertia is reduced an object, or person's, dimensions are compressed. A skilled technician can reverse such compression with a sonic screwdriver - but this will take a great deal of time. This same frequency based technique appears to be used by the Master's Tissue Compression Eliminator and Laser
Screwdriver.

Removal of the Stabilizers' Dimensional Control shrinks the interior micro-universe (all the rooms within it) down to the size of doll house (see illustration). Dimensional Stabilizers can suffer failures of synaptic adhesion or their chronostat can fail. The stabilizers are controlled by a series of blue buttons on the console. They should all be engaged to ensure a smooth flight. If a TARDIS dematerializes without the Stabilizers being properly reset, then the internal gravity will go into a "spin." Under such circumstance the operator should pull the manual override for the stabilizer that is found behind a small hatch at the base of the console's stem. If the Stabilizers are completely disabled, then the life support systems become inoperative.

If the Dimensional Control should fail while the crew is not on board, they will be unable to enter the TARDIS to perform repairs. In this case, it is recommended that the operator access the Scanner Circuits from outside the capsule and visually link the dimensional integrator circuits through the scanner linkages to act as a temporary stabilizer. This will enlarge the interior enough that proper repairs can be made. In an emergency, the Gravitic Anomaliser from the Force Field Generator can be used as a dimensional stabilizer if the main stabilizer is fused. Because Warp Drives are designed to also bank matter to achieve light speed travel, it is possible to construct a primitive Relative Dimensional Stabilizer out of the drive circuits of a space ship equipped with a warp drive using the following procedures:

1. Deactivate all drive circuits
2. Reverse the polarity of the main warp feeds
3.  Regrade the deoscillation digretic synthesizers by minus 10 points
4.  Realign the maxivectormeter on drags so they cross connect with the radia-bicentric anodes
5.  Switch the conceptual geometer from analogue to digital mode
6.  Begin triggering feedback responses from the conceptual geometer until a reading of 57-836 results
7. Reactivate all drive circuits

### Time Sceptre

All TARDISes have a core known as a Time Sceptre. It contains the control rooms, the power and drive systems, life support, and basic crew facilities. Each segment is an independent micro universe whose size isdependent upon the requirements of the systems it contains.

The tower of the Time Sceptre is enclosed in a spherical chamber that is several miles in diameter. The surface of this chamber appears to be made of grey and black clouds. Any rip in this chamber's structure would reveal the Vortex outside. This sphere is covered with numerous pods connected by rods. These are the extra rooms and corridors. New customized modules (rooms) are added when needed. Depending on the configuration there can also be multiple Corinthian columns within the chamber.

All Time Sceptres have the following major segments. From top to bottom these are:

- Interstitial Antenna
- Control Sphere
- Control Rooms
- Switch Room
- Core Service Module (CSM)
- Power Rooms
- Dynamorphic Generators
- Life Support
- Basic Crew Facilities
- Artron Mainframe
- TARDIS Information Systems
- Transpower System
- Eye of Harmony Containment Sphere

### Protyon Core (aka Power Room #5, Central Cortex Element)

Even the simplest TARDIS needs to be intelligent just to navigate the Vortex and keep itself whole. But more than sentience is required, to truly master dimensional stability in Space and Time an organic component is needed. For this reason, TARDISes are alive and semi-sentient. The Protyon Core serves as the Central Cortex Element and functions as the "brain" and "soul" of a TARDIS.

A TARDIS's Sentience Matrix is created with a Block Transfer System using specific artificial intelligence code. Using birthing matrices, the block-transfer artificial intelligence is rendered and physically formatted into several organic Protyon Units of morphologically unstable living protein. Each Protyon Unit is made up of a matrix of single-cell binary activators which function by flexing one way or another. Organic matter is used because only an organic mind can process Block-Transfer Mathematics. The matter needs to be morphologically unstable to adapt to the complex needs of a TARDIS. These Units are then implanted in the TARDIS's Core Service Module.

All the organic Protyon Units together form a Protyon Core that has a mental capacity and speed far beyond the human brain. This serves as the central cortex element or the brain of the TARDIS. The Protyon Core takes the form of a massive room filled with billions of organic eyes that wink on and off in binary. Due to its organic nature, each bit has some very limited decision making powers based on the input it receives. This makes it far more complex then traditional circuitry. It works on principles similar to the Matrix on Gallifrey and consists of a non-linear series of timeframes, which serve as neural pathways. The Central Cortex can make essential predictions concerning the currents and complexities of vortex travel. Dangerous Hadron Power Lines are used to supply power to block-transfer generators.

As a 4-dimensional life form that is capable of perceiving 11 dimensions, a TARDIS has casual probabilities instead of thoughts. These probabilities are only capable of replicating the most rudimentary of 3-dimensional thought processes.

A TARDIS cortex displays about the same amount of mental activity as a Time Lord. Most of that activity consists of monitoring and controlling the Relative Dimensional Stabilizers. Because of the RDS's role as an interface between the four dimensional TARDIS and its three dimensional crew the Relative Dimensional Stabilizers it is essential for the TARDIS to understand the desires and instructions of its operator. Control of the RDS takes up more of the Artron Mainframe's processing power than any other function, leaving only 5% of the processing capacity for other functions. Given the opportunity, a TARDIS will voluntarily communicate with other TARDISes, but attempts to fold this 11th dimensional matrix into some sort of mechanical verbal interface usually meet with failure.

A TARDIS's understanding of Time Lord thought processes is extremely limited (as are the Time Lord's understanding of a TARDIS). A TARDIS-Sentience Matrix can think, but in a manner similar to a machine, not that of a human. While sentient, it is not a true self-aware, sapient artificial intelligence. It tends to have a lot of trouble grasping the idea of personal identity and appears to lack a fully developed sense of consciousness. A properly maintained TARDIS doesn't have emotions. However, due to its four dimensional nature, it can anticipate some of the needs its crew will have.

This organic computer processes the Block-Transfer Equations from the pre-programmed TARDIS's Grey-Prints. A TARDIS, and almost everything inside, is generated by these equations. Even an outdated block-transfer modulator (with a few sticky-backed matter augmenters) can create massive (if simplistic) structures. Matter created by a TARDIS using block transfer has enhanced temporal properties and is resistant to being retro-annulled. This also makes it immune to the normal Vortex energies. During the Time War the matter used for the internal structure of a TARDIS was capable of withstanding a full-on thermonuclear blast. The Protyon Core's matter generation technology is used to generate custom designed modules and upgrade modules which are then linked (via space-time bridges) to the Core Service Module. A Protyon Unit uses the raw matter that makes up the walls of the Time Sceptre and unused secondary corridors and rooms to generate new modules as needed. The interior is constantly being reformed and remodelled The Protyon Core uses the auto-scan circuits to keep in constant communication with all parts of a TARDIS via Artron transmissions.

Any object the crew brings into a TARDIS will be replaced with a block-transfer duplicate if left alone long enough. Since it is now part of the TARDIS, this matter can be manipulated and deleted by the TARDIS.

A fully functional TARDIS is prohibited from creating mathematically modelled life-forms. And it is indeed impossible to create living matter using only block-transfer computations. However it is possible, and once created such life-forms can be reconfigured into other "species." It is even possible to use the organic protein of a Protyon Unit as a 'seed' to be reconfigured into other types of living matter. However, life-forms created by a TARDIS will have very simple programming. For this reason, it is impossible for a Protyon Unit alone to create fully sapient life-forms. Any life-form that is taken out of the confines of the TARDIS's micro-universe runs the risk of encountering complex ideas that it was not programmed to handle. In such circumstances the construct will overload and it will begin to convert into artron energy. It would require a TARDIS's entire power reserves and a merger with Gallifreyan Biodata just to create one stable human. It would be impossible to create a full Gallifreyan using this process.

The TARDIS Matrix and Protyon Core are protected by warning messages, a firewall, and Teleplasmic Minefields. This is a necessary precaution because damage to the Protyon Units can disable the link with the Prime Eye of Harmony. It can also be infected by creatures like the transmittable Virus of the Purpose - but it will quickly purge its systems with a rather explosive energy discharge in the control room. Outright deleting a TARDIS Matrix would blow a hole in the Universe. Because of the danger of outright deleting a TARDIS Sentient Matrix some criminal elements have discovered that it is possible to transfer the sentient matrix into the body of a lesser species, such as a human, so that the matrix would burn out while a safe distance from the main control room. A TARDIS which loses its sapient matrix will lose almost all power, with little more then the lights remaining operational.

Cramming a TARDIS Matrix into a human body that has been emptied of its original consciousness is dangerous. The Matrix will have a tendency to burst the mind's conceptual framework. The human body will begin to suffer kidney failure and other complications and will be dead in under two hours. Secret Time Lords research has discovered that the life span can be greatly increased by carefully preparing the lesser being and by leaving its original consciousness intact before implanting a TARDIS Sentience. But this physical stability came at a cost. Despite trying over 50 different lesser species in all but two cases the resulting being was completely insane. This was due to incompatibilities between the neural configuration of each being. Even a Time Lord will find his mind destroyed if forced to contain a TARDIS sentience. There is at least one known case of a Time Lady linking herself to her TARDIS's Protyon Core at the exact moment of her regeneration. The artron energy was channelled into the TARDIS, causing the two of them to become, in essence, one being, with the TARDIS functioning as her body. While the subject suffered massive psychological damage the network was stable, and remained so until outside input disrupted it.

Damage to the Protyon Units can disable the link with the Prime Eye of Harmony. Such damage can be repaired using morphologically unstable organic matter. Some of the very few races that can create this type of matter are the Time Lords, Axos, and possibly the Nestenes. However, care must be taken that this matter doesn't contain any dangerous contaminants.

### Multidimensional Grey Prints

These are the complete schematics and plans for a TARDIS. After a TARDIS leaves the Neural Construction Docks, they are locked within the Master Control Console and used by the Molecular Stabilizers to repair a TARDIS. Like the Eye of Harmony, physical access to them is usually limited to occasional overhauls every 3000 years.

### Architectural Configuration Program

The Spatial Distribution Circuits use the Architectural Configuration Program to control the interior space allocation with in the Pedestrian Infrastructure. Since a TARDIS's rooms and corridors are made from mathematical building blocks, its architecture can be remoulded The operator can exert direct control of the interior architecture, designing things as he sees fit. The Protyon Core's matter generation technology is used to generate custom designed modules (aka Storage Rooms) and upgrade modules which are then linked (via space-time bridges called Dimensional Junctures) to the Core Service Module. Using these Matter Control Projectors that surround the Core Service Module, the Dimensional Stabilizers can control any add-on modules. Once the changes are programmed in they can be implemented by pushing the red EXECUTE button.

The Power and Storage Rooms of a TARDIS are accessed via service tunnels (aka corridors), galleries, walkways, stairways, escalators, and lifts. Using Dimensional Junctures the rooms don't even have to be connected in any logical or mappable fashion. Multiple doorways can lead to the same room, and a single doorway can lead to two different places depending on which way you walk through it. Some Time Lords frown on these sorts of configurations and believe that a properly stabilized Pedestrian Infrastructure should be able to be easily mapped in three dimensions.

Temporal Locks are another way to customize the architecture. They can be used to separate part of the TARDIS interior, such as a Storage Room. Temporal Locks can even be used to connect that room to Normal Space via a Real World Interface. Once set up, a Temporal Lock is activated or deactivated by pressing the three green light-up buttons, found inside the room in question. The interior can also be reconfigured to trap hostile entities in dead end corridors.

Using this Architectural Configuration Program the operator can lock or unlock any door in a TARDIS interior from the console (there is a white flash around the frame when a door locks or unlocks). Pass keys for the locks consist of a series of mental images that the TARDIS reads telepathically. And example might be: Crimson 11 delight "smell of dust after rain.' It is even possible to set up a temporal bubble around a particular room, effectively trapping everything within the room inside an endless time loop. Under certain dangerous situations the TARDIS will put the inside of the control room into a time loop to protect the crew within a temporal bubble. It should be noted that complex modifications are very difficult, and the operator must have a Rassilon Imprimature or (at minimum) be telepathically linked with a TARDIS to ensure success.

While it is possible to vary the total interior volume of a TARDIS (see Dimensional Transcendence), a standard TARDIS has a million rooms and at least 12 levels. The total volume of rooms and corridors of a complete Type 40 TARDIS has been described as being about the size of a small town. It's also been described at being at least twice the size of San Francisco's Chinatown at the beginning of the 21st century. A fully guided tour of a Type 40 TARDIS could take a couple of years. Regardless of how the lifts and stairs are configured, a person will feel they are moving deeper the closer one gets to the Cloister Room.

Since the interior of a TARDIS is a Micro-Universe, if one sets off in one direction, one will eventually return to one's point of origin. For this reason a TARDIS could (like the N-Space Universe) be considered practically "infinite." This phenomenon is called infinite recursion.

The Protyon Core keeps in constant communication with all parts of a TARDIS using Artron transmissions. The individual rooms of a TARDIS can be located using the spatial distribution circuits, which detect the unbalanced energy each room has with respect to the outside world. These rooms are monitored with the Architectural Configuration Indicators, ensuring that every part of a TARDIS is in constant communication with every other part. It should be noted that while Storage and Power Rooms are detectable, Zero Rooms are balanced to zero energy, and thus don't appear on the Architectural Configuration Indicators.

A TARDIS is constantly reforming, remodelling and redecorating various parts of its interior. In theory these redecorations are done in a manner that will be pleasing to the TARDIS's operator, but sometimes they are due to random dimensional feedback. The dimensional scale stabilizer controls the time frequency in an attempt to minimize such alterations.

Minor alterations to the architecture can also occur when a TARDIS diverts Artron Energy to assist in a Time Lord's regeneration. Being four-dimensional beings, TARDISes are even able to alter the architecture to accommodate new passengers before the ship's Time Lord knows there will be a new passenger. Under these and other circumstances, the TARDIS will perform an automatic architectural reconfiguration. This can extend to rearranging and creating new living rooms. A TARDIS with Time War era upgrades automatically reconfigures the architecture to make sure the room he needs comes to him. And some renegade units will create rooms the operator will need centuries in advance of when they are needed. Over time a TARDIS grows, acquiring additional polychoral facets. When a TARDIS acquires extra internal dimensions its acronym changes from Time and Relative Dimension in Space to Time and Relative Dimensions in Space.

Every TARDIS comes with a default tangential formation which determines the location and floor plan of its power and storage rooms. Despite the changes outlined above, the interior is always organized according to a specific geometry, which can be followed if you understand the pattern. The Time Sceptre is the central structure which contains the Interstitial Antenna, Control Rooms, Switch Room, Power Rooms, Dynamorphic Generators, Life Support, Basic Crew Facilities, Artron Mainframe, Transpower System, and the Cloister room. All other storage rooms are located in pods around the outer surface of the spherical micro-universe. Other things that remain fairly constant are the general floor plan (which does tend to vary slowly over time), and the colour, which by default is off-white. It is not unknown for a rebellious TARDIS to hide rooms from the operator's internal schematics. Virtually all of the artronic, communications, and power linkages in a TARDIS pass through Dimensional Junctures to get wherever they need to be. It takes a deliberate program by the operator to alter the fundamental tangential formation. See the Chapter on Storage Rooms for more information.

Using the Architectural Coordinate Selector, specific rooms can be deleted. Deleted rooms can either be jettisoned into the Space-Time Vortex or they can be converted into Artron Energy. A hard-wired fail-safe ensures that any living things located in a room that is being deleted will automatically be deposited in the Primary Control Room. When a room is delete the door (or doors) will remain behind in the service tunnel; opening to a roundel covered wall. Deletion of a room is accomplished by collapsing its shell and feeding them into a Mass Converter. When calculating the energy release the operator is reminded that in the extra-temporal physics of the 5th dimension E = mc3. Since the mass of unused rooms can be converted into energy it is possible that a TARDIS creates the extra rooms to serve as an auxiliary power source. It would take the TARDIS less then a decade to regenerate several thousand tons of interior mass. The multidimensional mass of a complete TARDIS has been known to reach 68 thousand metric tonnes, but no upper limit has been discovered. It should be noted, that if the Architectural Configuration Program is used while a TARDIS is in the Vortex only the number of rooms to be moved/deleted can be specified, but the actual choice of which rooms are moved/deleted is completely random. Under such circumstances the fail-safe will not function.

If the Pedestrian Infrastructure is destabilized, then the corridors and internal doors of a Timeship will be connected to different places depending on what angle you approach them. The Master Control Console might even appear in one of the storage rooms. If an outside stimulus ever forces the TARDIS to perform an automatic architectural reconfiguration the Time Lord will suffer trauma through his symbiotic link. These mental instabilities can release his past incarnations from inside his mind. This multiple personality disorder will last until the architecture is restored to as stable state. The destabilization can be repaired by having the operator form a direct telepathic connection with the TARDIS. Once this is done the architecture will reset to its normal configuration.

### Desktop Theme (aka Environmental Metaphor)

A TARDIS interior micro-universe is created using Transcendental Equations that don't interface with Normal Space in a traditional way. The Default State of a TARDIS interior includes a Psychosculpture Environmental Metaphor. The three dimensional form of the Pedestrian Infrastructure is created by the Hynoleptic Interface and driven by a device similar to a Chameleon Circuit. The Imagery Enhancer Systems fine tune the process. Without the illusion of the Environmental Metaphor the interior TARDIS would be seen as a multidimensional bioentity. Thanks to their time brain, Time Lords are able to function in this environment without significant problems. But the multi-dimensional psychic nature of the interior will drive lesser species mad with visions of sinuous and churning monstrosities. Non-sentient beings (i.e. entities without proper biodata) will only be mildly nauseous when viewing the interior without the Metaphor.

The interior has about as much possibility for variation as the exterior does. The Wallpaper Controls are used to alter the Environmental Metaphor's Desktop Theme. The colour for the default interior is off-white. Since six is a very important number in Gallifreyan culture the hexagonal form is a common structural shape in Gallifreyan architecture. Hexagons can be found in the shape of many consoles and control rooms, and are often used to decorate the walls. However, individual rooms (and perhaps the entire interior) can be remodelled by changing the Desktop Theme. Default-white, Coral, Leopard-Skin, Wood-Panelled, and Gothic are just some of the many standard options. Depending on the complexity of the upgrades it can take anywhere from less then a day to several months for the TARDIS to redecorate its console room. During this time the TARDIS will place a sign on the door to that room that says "Closed for refurbishment". The TARDIS key will glow to indicate that the redecorations are complete. Normally all storage rooms and corridors follow the control room's theme, but systems faults can result in some areas retaining older disused themes. Some renegade timeships have been known to secretly archive old control rooms (and sometimes even new themes that haven't been selected yet). Since it is designed to function as something of a Safe Mode, the Secondary Control Room desk-top theme can't be altered from default.

A TARDIS can automatically redecorate various parts of its interior. In theory these redecorations are done in a manner that will be pleasing to the TARDIS's operator, but sometimes they are due to random dimensional feedback. Minor alterations to the architecture can also occur when a TARDIS diverts Artron Energy to assist in a Time Lord's regeneration.

Some types of customization can be implemented instantly. For example, the hardness of the floors and walls are adjusted for the comfort of the crew. The interior lighting is controlled from a switch on the console and can be raised to painful brightness. Operators who decide to paint the inside of the TARDIS should be careful as paint can easily jam a TARDIS's systems. During the Time War the matter used for the internal structure of a TARDIS can withstand a full-on thermonuclear blast.

### Auto-Systems

These devices and programs are responsible for the interior Environmental Metaphor of a TARDIS. These include the Protyon Unit, Relative Dimensional Stabilizers, Time Vector Generator, and Architectural Configuration Program.

The Auto-Systems also ensure that a TARDIS's Reality Quotient remains stable at 0.9 and that the crew members' quotients remain at 1. If displaced from their proper time state the Auto-Systems will attempt to correct the problem, but they will need a Standing Wave (created by a binary induction system) to home in on.

### Life Support Systems (aka Power Room #6)

The Life Support Systems are located in another of the Power Rooms. These systems include the Dimensional Stabilizers, Atmosphere Monitoring Subsystems, and the Auto-Gravity System. The Life Support Systems can support several thousands of humanoids. Minor life support needs, like interior lighting, are usually powered by the auxiliary power source.

Aside from the glowing roundels there are no obvious light sources in a TARDIS – nevertheless the interior will be quite well lit. This is due to Visual Stabilizer Circuits which are capable of generating and[/unoff[ controlling photons anywhere in the TARDIS. The interior lights can be controlled from a switch on the console or by voice commands. The light levels can be raised to painful brightness. A TARDIS has an optional diurnal (day/night) cycle. Interior lighting, are usually powered by the auxiliary power source.

Normally the interior of a TARDIS is quite sterile. Given that there is only one case of the TARDIS crew spreading an organic virus from one time zone to another the TARDIS must have some sort of anti-viral software. The beneficial environment of the TARDIS can help in prevent wounded people from passing out.

The environmental systems always plays a very light melody in the background to soothe and relax its crew members This melody sounds like a steady hum to non-Gallifreyans. The tone of the hum changes depending on whether the TARDIS is materialized or in the Vortex.

### Atmosphere Monitoring Subsystem

This system uses the Relative Dimensional Stabilizers to control the type and amount of atmosphere pumped into a TARDIS. The Subsystem has an automatic-cleaning device so used air is recycled, purified, and reclaimed by the Automatic Oxygen Supply System. A dial on the console acts as a barometer and thermometer.

It automatically adjusts the internal temperature and humidity for the comfort of the crew. Despite this, humans often find the internal atmosphere somewhat drier than what they are used to. Trakenites, on the other hand find it uncomfortably warm and humid. If a TARDIS lands on a habitable planet it will draw air from the outside and filter it. The air is kept antiseptically clean, though some complain about the high levels of static electricity.

If the interior hum is ever deactivated, then the life support system can be faintly heard. It sounds like very slow breathing. Individual rooms can have the air evacuated. An alarm will sound if the life-support systems are about to fail. For such occasions there is a portable Emergency Unit with enough air for six hours. In the Mark X upgrades, emergency life-support masks will drop down in the control room for each crew member.

The TARDIS's circuitry (especially the Protyon Core) is vulnerable to high temperatures (over 40 degrees Celsius). The exo-shell is equipped with coolant systems run by the thermal protection circuits. But when the internal environment's temperature rises beyond a TARDIS's engineering tolerances, then the thermal cut-out will switch in and disable all automatic controls. The thermal cut-out will deactivate when the thermal protection circuits have returned the TARDIS to a safe temperature (this usually takes a few hours). This cooling time can be reduced by venting the Thermo-Buffer, which will return interior of a TARDIS to normal temperature in much less then an hour. If exposed to freezing conditions for too long (say if the main doors are left open) the thermo-couplings might become chilled. This can result in a rocky dematerialization. For this reason it is important to keep the main doors closed if the exterior environment is sub zero.

### Autocleaning Systems

Any object brought into the TARDIS will be replaced with a block-transfer duplicate if left alone long enough. Since it is now part of the TARDIS this block transfer matter can be manipulated and deleted. A TARDIS's autocleaning system uses Block-Transfer to remove all unnecessary dust, mud, and debris from its interior. If the operator desires, the systems can be balanced to allow dust and cobwebs to gather in disused rooms. The Autocleaning systems' Laundry Circuits automatically repair, clean, and iron any clothes left overnight in the sleeping quarters.

### Auto-Gravity System

This system can use the Internal Gravity Compensators to create a stable gravity field within a TARDIS regardless of the exterior gravity field. It can compensate even if positioned on the surface of a neutron star.

The Attitude Control automatically uses the pitch gyroscopic stabilizer, pitch stabilizer, and the Internal Gravity Compensators to act as inertial dampers to prevent serious damage due to acceleration/gravity disruption. The corridors have an anti-grav function so it is difficult to hurt oneself by tripping. It should be noted the system is not foolproof, and injury or death can still result from bad falls.

Normally this system automatically adjusts the gravity, within reason, while in the Vortex to acclimatize the crew to the local gravity of the destination. The telepathic circuits prevent the crew from noticing these changes. It might be possible for the crew to be given a non-gravitational existence that would persist outside the TARDIS. The gravity can be manually controlled and the setting of individual rooms can be configured separately. The Internal gravity can be increased to the point where it will kill a Time Lord.

Some Type 40's had intermittent faults in their Attitude Control resulting in damage and injury from exterior acceleration/gravity disruption. The operator can compensate for this by frequently re-setting the pitch stabilizer's manual control to automatic.

### The Ancillary Power Station

This Power Room contains the Emergency Storage Cells. These quantum-field generators serve as a non-Artron
auxiliary power source if the Eye of Harmony should prove insufficient. The Transpower System charges them whenever a TARDIS is in Normal Space. Minor life support needs, like interior lighting, are usually powered by the auxiliary power source. The emergency lighting system uses red lights. A TARDIS can be put on Emergency Power to prevent it being detected (See Stealth Mode).

Assuming some power is available, using the Architectural Coordinate Selector, specific rooms can be converted into Artron Energy, by collapsing their shells and feeding them into a TARDIS's Mass Converter. If these Emergency Power Units fail, there are also Back-up System of emergency storage cells that can provide limited power.

In the event of a sudden loss of all power, a red light on the console will illuminate. In the Mark X upgrades, emergency life-support masks will drop down in the control room for each crew member. Aside from these masks the only source of air, gravity, heat, and other life-support needs is what "leaks" in from the outside environment. The Block-Transfer equations that make up the interior and exterior of a TARDIS are mathematically stable. Should all power in a TARDIS fail, the interior will remain structurally sound but the flow of time on the interior will slow down relative to the exterior.

### Transducer Power Cells

These Power Cells are among the first thing to grow on a newborn TARDIS. If these Emergency Power Units fail, there is also a back-up system of emergency storage cells that can provide limited power. Using a hyperspatial loop this power can be transferred to the Transpower System. These transducer power cells can allow the TARDIS to absorb thousands, if not millions, of megawatts of almost any type of energy (including electrical output from a nuclear reactor). The Power Cells are even capable of absorbing the raw artron energy of a Time Lord's future. It takes 24 hours to charge a Power Cell.

### Internal Scanner

The Internal Scanner has its own Power Room. This Scanner allows the operator to visually inspect all 15 Power Rooms.

### Fault Locator

When programmed to run a Basic Reality Check, this device gives a Ship Status Report, which lists all of the ship's instrumentation in green alphanumeric code (A14D, QR18, K17, etc.). The Codes are listed consecutively. Three lights show the status of the instrumentation: green for normal, yellow for standby, and red for malfunction. Malfunctioning parts are also denoted by a flashing text. Systems marked with a standby (yellow) notice should be examined as soon as possible. Malfunctioning systems (red) are partially or completely unusable. A single red light indicate the failure of individual component. But if all the lights on the Fault Locator were to activate it would mean the ship was about to disintegrate. The Locator can also provide the operator with a printout. While the scan takes only 3 seconds, it takes about ten minutes for the Locator's visual display unit to display the status of every instrument on a TARDIS. Operators are cautioned that the Fault Locator can't pinpoint stuck switches or misaligned controls.

The Fault Locator is made of an entire wall of computer banks, found in the Fault Locator Power Room, near the Secondary Control Room. There is also a readout display under a flap on the console. To ensure reliability the Fault Locator operates on a completely different system and has its own power source. The Fault Locator is also used to activate Self-Repair Mode.

### Service and Check-ups

TARDISes should receive service every 500 to 1000 years. Most of a TARDIS's exitonic circuitry is accessible behind the roundels in the walls. The roundels will remain lit even when removed. Time Lords that skip this maintenance are likely to experience total system breakdowns and possibly even the destruction of their TARDIS. A TARDIS that is abandoned for over 3,000 years will break down and die from lack of maintenance. For this reason they should receive a check-up and overhaul every 3000 years. It takes about a month to overhaul a TARDIS.

When making modifications, it is important to shut down everything, except that which is not necessary to shut down. Operators are warned that some TARDISes gets quite upset when their parts are removed and used in other devices. They tend to hold a grudge about this and operate unpredictably for quite some time after being used as a technology donor.

### Molecular Stabilizers

hese are used by a TARDIS when in Self-Repair Mode (also known as Regeneration Mode) to "regenerate" and repair itself when damaged. The process relies on nano-technology similar to a Time Lord's regenerative biogenic molecules. The Molecular Stabilizers undertake a regeneration cycle that repairs its systems on a molecular level. This form of circuitry regeneration is one of the Time Lord's most advanced techniques. The Molecular Stabilizers can even be used to accelerate the circuit regeneration of technology other then a TARDIS if it is linked through a frequency modulator. If the TARDIS is severely damaged the self-repair circuits might require so much power that the Scanner will not operate.

For their own safety, crew members should remain outside their TARDIS while it is self-repair mode. For this reason the Control Room is deprived of oxygen during self-repair. Though TARDIS scar tissue bears a strong resemblance to mercury, the Molecular Stabilizers cannot manufacture some raw elements such as Mercury or Zyton-7.

Given time, a TARDIS can rebuild/grow new Control Rooms (if one is destroyed or jettisoned). Indeed, even if a TARDIS suffers enough damage to reduce it to a 1 inch cube the stabilizer will still be able to re-grow itself. For more on this see TARDIS Cloning.

### Time-Link

If possible, a badly damaged TARDIS will automatically time-link itself to a healthier one to stay alive. When Time-Linked the dying TARDIS's chameleon circuit and desktop theme will instantly be re-configured to match the pattern of the healthy one. This will stabilize the flow of time inside the capsule. When two TARDISes are time-linked it is possible for the healthy TARDIS to aid the dying one in travelling the Vortex by generating a wormhole within the Vortex for it to travel along. This can be done by synchronizing the coordinates, making sure the calibrators are online, and dematerializing at the exact same time as the wounded capsule.

### Dimensional Collapse

Dimensional Collapse occurs when a TARDIS's internal dimensions collapse in on themselves and the Exo-Plasmic Shell suffers isomorphic mass-degeneration. Internal Dimensional Collapse can occur when a TARDIS experiences a severe trauma (such as the death of its operator) or because of the removal of the Time Vector Generator. When the damage is repaired, a TARDIS will draw power from the Prime Eye of Harmony on Gallifrey and use it to re-grow. The internal configurations will probably be scrambled and redecorated. Without the Prime Eye of Harmony, it will take about a century to re-grow itself using only the Artron Energy of its operator. A TARDIS will need to be in close contact with a Time Lord during that time. For more information on this re-growth see the entry on TARDIS Cloning. A TARDIS will "die" if it remains in Dimensional Collapse for more than a few decades.

## TARDIS Defence Systems

One of the logical consequences of travelling throughout space and time is that sometimes a TARDIS will find itself in situations that are dangerous, either to the TARDIS itself, or to its crew. As a result, TARDISes have a number of systems designed to protect themselves and their occupants. This section describes these systems.

### Automatic Defence Mechanism (aka Banshee Circuits)

The Automatic Defence Mechanisms (ADM) consists of all of the defensive systems normally controlled by the Banshee Circuits. These include the Cloister Bell, Safety Precaution Selector, Temporal Grace Field, Chameleon Circuit, HADS, and the Warp Ellipse Cut-out Circuit.

In an emergency the Banshee Circuits allow a TARDIS to use any resources available (including temporarily altering or controlling people, places, dreams and memories) to ensure the survival of the Capsule and its crew. The ADM has been known to put images on the Scanner to warn the crew of a dangerous location or situation. Its detection systems are known to be quite accurate, but sensitive enough that some operators disconnect certain systems to keep it from interfering.

Sometimes it will double-lock the doors (preventing entrance or exit) until the danger has passed. If necessary, parts of a TARDIS interior will dissolve into viscous metallic liquid as a TARDIS diverts resources to the Molecular Stabilizers. In certain extreme situations the TARDIS will dematerialize as soon as the operator enters the ship. In one case a rovie mouse was exposed to a time fallout from a leak in the capsule's temporal relays. Rather then being aged to dust the TARDIS did its best to reprocess its biodata to keep the mouse alive. This resulted in the mouse undergoing thousands of years of evolution in less then a minute.

This mechanism is a optional extra built into Mark I TARDIS systems. The Banshee Circuits also serve as the Temporal Flight Recorder which stores any flight codes that are used.

While it is easy for Gallifrey to get a signal lock on a stolen TARDIS that has switched off all of its defence systems, some operators use a switch on the console to keep the ADM disconnected because they resent how overly sensitive to threat it is. There are some emergency systems that will switch themselves back on even if deactivated by the operator. If the operator diverts all of a TARDIS's power to its Drive Systems it will be unable to activate its defence mechanisms. It would then be possible for intruders to breach the main doors.

### Cloister Bell

The Cloister Bell is a signal to the crew that a catastrophe that could threaten even a TARDIS is occurring or will soon occur. In short it is a call to "battle-stations." Cloister Bells can be found on all TARDISes since the Type 22.

The bell will ring for events ranging from is the phasing of the TARDIS engines, to the detection of a vortex discontinuity, to the imminent heat death of the universe. Though it is located in the Cloister Room, the Bell can be heard from anywhere in a TARDIS. Normally controlled by the Main Logic Junction, the Cloister Bell is linked to the flow of the Universe and thus able to predict many disasters before they occur. Even when the TARDIS Sentient Matrix is unconscious the Main Logic Junction can still trigger the bell. The Cloister Bell can also be manually rung from the Control Room by crew members The High Council of Gallifrey can send a signal that will cause every Cloister Bell in the Universe to ring.

### Warp Ellipse Cutout Circuit

ATARDIS has a Warp Ellipse Cutout Circuit, which triggers an Automatic Emergency Landing and an alarm if a TARDIS is about to collide with a vessel in spatial-temporal warp ellipse orbit. It was erroneously believed that vessels with the ability to enter spatial-temporal orbit were never built. Operators should be aware that a difficult temporal deviation will be required to escape from a spatial-temporal warp ellipse.

### Safety Precaution Switch

The original version of this system was invented by the Doctorand can be found on all timeships with Mark IV status. When enabled, this system collects data 1 microsecond after Materialization Switch #2 is toggled and prevents a TARDIS from materializing around, or embedding itself in, an object. It also triggers when other threatening circumstances can be found in the arrival area. In such circumstances the Safety Precaution Switch (SPS) prevents the demat circuit from extend the exo-plasmic shell into real space.

A later version of the SPS automatically shifts the TARDIS to a secluded and reasonably safe materialization site. It will avoid materializing underwater, or in solid rock. If such an arrival seems likely, the Selector will instead find a submerged vessel with a breathable atmosphere or (in the case of being underground) will find a cave. The Selector can be fine-tuned to prevent a TARDIS from materializing on the edge of a cliff, or even on planets where the local technology falls below a pre-selected level.

As with most systems, the operator has the option of overriding the Selector. In this case, if the TARDIS is going to materialize inside a solid object, the cloister bell will ring. If the TARDIS was to materialize inside a wall it could take 5 days or more to safely separate the timeship.

### Exo-Chronoplasmic Shell

The exterior of a TARDIS is made up of a Chronoplasmic Shell composed of atoms of rare TARDIS metals (including mercury and in some experimental capsules, Validium) and inorganic polymers. It exists as a Real World Complex Space-Time Event that is Time Mapped onto the interior using Real World Logic Gearing, made up of Complex Block-Transfer equations. The Time Sensor Control fine-tunes the exact space-time coordinates of the molecules that make up a TARDIS. The shell holds the dimensional threshold that connects to the Micro-Universe within.[/ttv]

The Chronoplasmic Shell is driven by the Chameleon Circuit. The default state for the shell of a Type 15-52 TARDIS is a silver-grey metallic cube 3 meters on each side. For a later Types, the exterior is a white domed topped cylinder 2 meters tall and 1.2 meters in diameter. When in its default state the outer surface of the shell will appear, on close examination, to be rippling and changing like something unreal or dreamlike. Similarly the Exo-Shell's mass is distributed over the first 5 dimensions. This means that, from a 3-dimensional point of view, the outer shell has variable mass that tends to fluctuate over time. Thus the density of the shell tends to be different every time it is measured. While disguised as a police box a TARDIS weighs significantly less then 1,200 pounds. But the shell can reach a density of up to 2,300 grams per cubic centimetre

Tachyon detectorIt is possible to use the chameleon circuit to create a small cubbyhole compartment to store a spare TARDIS Key. The specific Type of a TARDIS can be determined by checking the molecular patina of its Shell. The exterior does emit low levels of Tachyons, which can be detected using the proper equipment. The internal energy of a TARDIS can be diverted to the outer shell, delivering a massive blast of energy to anything it comes in contact with. Under the right atmospheric conditions this energy discharge can be modulated to induce precipitation in the exterior environment using basic atmospheric excitation.

Since the shell's atoms are merely Block-Transfer constructs, the exterior of a TARDIS is immune to almost all attacks and the design specifications state that it is 'technically indestructible' (even without the Force Field). It is immune to diamond and borazon drills, thermic lances, sonic lances, laser cutters, and meteor collision. The heart of a star does produce enough heat to instantly vaporize the capsule. If the Operator desires it, the TARDIS's defences can be disabled so that its exo-shell is no stronger then the object it is disguised as. If the exoshell was to develop a crack, chronon radiation would be released. To a lesser species this would appear to be a white glow.

The exterior is also radar-absorptive, making it invisible on some tracking systems. However, microscopic elements (such as bacteria) from each destination will often become embedded in the Shell. 

The External Decontamination Function (EDF) can be used to sterilize the Shell leaving it appearing pristine and clean. 

While the entire Exo-Shell can be transmatted or transducted without difficulty, the Interior cannot be penetrated by transmat beams unless the beam's power has been increased by a factor of 50 million. Certain gravitic, thermal, telepathic, and radioactive forces will be transferred to the inside (if the force fields are deactivated). Most of these forces (including gravity) can be negated by isolating this exterior shell from the interior Micro-Universe.

Certain violations of the 3rd Law of Time can stress the TARDIS's defence mechanisms, weakening the exo-shell. Under such circumstances, the corporeal shell could be shattered by something a small as a sub-sonic cannon ball. Such damage won't threaten the interior micro-universe, but the TARDIS will have to abandon most of the broken shell and re-grow an new one from what's left. If possible the TARDIS will use the HADS to retreat into the Vortex while this is done. Re-growing the exo-shell can take several weeks to complete, and the new shell will remain white until the process is complete.

Some areas of space are dangerous to a TARDIS interior. The Zeg Zone is one such area of space. The Electromagnetic Pulse Signature interferes with electrical and exitonic circuitry. If exposed to this radiation for too long the console will explode. Shortly after that, the TARDIS will seal its doors until it has repaired the damage and TARDIS has been physically transported out of range of the radiation.

In an emergency the TARDIS's exo-shell can also be used to temporarily plug some types of holes in space-time. In the post-Time War era severe temporal paradox can attract Reapers, which often leads to a break the link between a TARDIS's interior and its exo-shell. Faced with attacking Reapers, a TARDIS will separate its Exo-Shell from the interior universe to protect itself. This is done disconnecting its Time Vector Generator - leaving its Exo-Shell abandoned. The TARDIS will still retain a link with its Key and its owner. If the paradox that attracted the Reapers is removed, then the TARDIS will reactivated by the Time Vector Generator.

The exo-shell can be displaced from the current time-cone making it disappear. The auto-systems will try to return to the original time zone but need a standing wave generated by a binary induction system to home in on. A massive exterior gravitational force can warp the inner dimensions against the outer shell until a catastrophic schism develops in the outer shell. If this were to occur the interior of a TARDIS would break out and be randomly mapped into the area. This situation can be rectified with a sufficiently complex and powerful gravitational field that can draw the interior segments together, allowing the Endo and Exo-Shells to reform.

### Chameleon Circuit

This dimensionally transcendental circuit controls the exterior shell's Cloaking Device and Camouflage Unit. The Camouflage Unit allows the shape, colour, mass and texture of the Shell to be altered to blend in with its surroundings. This feature is designed to help prevent changes to history. Chameleon Circuits were developed soon after the Gallifreyans began travelling in time.

This was done because lost timeships were creating legends and mythologies of monsters and gods among the lesser species. The Chameleon Microcircuits can be accessed by removing a roundel in the access tunnel near Control Room Number 2.

Even a detailed scan of the atoms of the exo-shell will reveal its molecular structure to be consistent with its disguise. The Perception Filter further augments the Chameleon Circuit's disguise. The choice of disguises is nearly infinite (trees, police boxes, chairs, an entire lake, an Egyptian Shabti, or even ionized gas) An Ionic Column disguise comes as one of the factory presets for a TARDIS. If a TARDIS is disguised as an object that is too small for a standard sized door then (once the key is inserted) a door will appear hanging in mid-air outside the capsule.

Usually the operator chooses the disguise. The Type 40 has an early version of the Chameleon Circuit, and to create a new disguise the operator must use a retractable keypad that extends out of console when a switch under the console is thrown. This keypad allows new disguises to be created manually with machine code. Pre-used disguises are automatically accessible. Type 40 TARDISes make a whooshing noise when their chameleon circuit alters the exo-shell.

All Type 58 and later timeships (as well as TARDISes with the Mark IV upgrade) are designed to automatically scan the target area right before materialization and automatically select a disguise that will hide it. Since every piece of matter in the universe casts an image in the Vortex, a TARDIS can scan this image. During the first nano-second of materialization the TARDIS creates a 12 dimensional data map of everything within a thousand mile radius and determines which outer shell would best blend in with its environment. It then imprints this image on its exo-shell (or its infrastructure), allowing it to precisely duplicate the appearance of the nearby object. It is possible to use the manual override codes to select a different disguise. If a TARDIS is abandoned by its operator it will deactivate most of its systems, and alter its appearance as necessary to avoid attracting attention. One operator of a Type 40 augmented his Chameleon Circuit so that it would operate automatically, but the TARDIS's choice of disguise tended to be inappropriate.

This automatic feature of a Mark IV Chameleon Circuit can be overridden by the operator if desired. And the change implemented after materialization. If a TARDIS has materialized around an object, the Chameleon Circuit can be set to automatically imitate that object. It should be noted that this will only be a loose copy of the object, and that (without complex and careful programming) the disguise will lack any true functionality. It is possible to Time Map the internal dimensions onto the external dimensions. This will increase the Exo-Plasmic Shell to the size of a small moon or planet. However it will limit the capabilities of some of the Defence Mechanisms.

Every time the Chameleon Circuit creates a new exo-shell to disguise the TARDIS a duplicate of the shell is stored in the Shell Room. It should be noted that even if the Chameleon Circuit suffers a complete system breakdown the Shell Room will still continue to collect new unused shells every time the TARDIS materializes.

The shell of a fully operational TARDIS has a very slight vibration that can be detected with the right equipment. However if the Chameleon circuit is faulty, the outer Plasmic Shell might produce an audible hum and an easily detectable vibration. Faulty chameleon circuits have also been known to leak chronon radiation out of any "windows" that are part of the chameleon disguise. This takes the form of white light to a lesser species. Removal of the Visual Stabilization Circuit's fusion plate leaves a TARDIS invisible. Not only does this cause an enormous drain on the timeship's power reserves, but it makes finding the keyhole and the Dimensional Gateway difficult.

It is possible to disable the Exo-Shell's invulnerability so that it is only as strong as the object it is currently disguised as. This is not recommended, since the endo-shell traditionally has only modest structural integrity. Under such circumstances a collision or attack with enough kinetic energy could penetrate the Control Room.

Older TARDISes (such as the Type 40) were prone to system breakdowns of their Chameleon Circuits, which would freeze the exterior appearance. They required regular Chameleon Conversions to combat this tendency. This involves hotbinding the fragment-links and superseding the binary coding with the right block-transfer equations. Care should be taken when performing a Chameleon Conversion. Errors in data fed into a TARDIS during the conversion will cause a dimensional spiral leading to the shrinkage of the exo-shell. Sonic projectors can be used to create a temporary zone of stasis to halt the spiral, but the only way to reverse the spiral is to correct the errors in the original data. It is also possible for a failed conversion to cause the TARDIS to try to mimic a living organism with the exoshell. Under such circumstances that Artron Mainframe would become completely devoted to maintaining this complex dynamic disguise and operator would have to find a way to remind the ship that it was something more then just a simple organic life-form. For this reason, it is recommended the operator consult the TARDIS Manual before attempting any repairs. These problems were fixed with the introduction of the Type 65. Despite all the advances of the Type 65, some types of TARDIS produced after the Type 40 (specifically the models popular at the time of the assassination of President Eldhind) had much more limited Chameleon Circuits than the Type 40.

If left in the same shape for several years a TARDIS could suffer from chameleonic fluctuation, which causes the exterior to slowly alter its exterior shape and colour over time. Each alteration will be minor but the cumulative effect could be quite noticeable. A breakdown between the Basal Programming and the Autonomous Elements will cause a TARDIS to go into Chameleonic Spasm, leading to wild fluctuations in the appearance and size of the exterior shell.

### Perception Filter (aka Distraction Field)

Timeships conceal themselves by embedding themselves into local culture - making the capsule even harder to notice. While the Auto-Systems ensure that crew members' Reality Quotient remains stable at 1.0 the Quotient of the TARDIS itself remains at only 0.9. This lower quotient is achieved using the dimensionally transcendental chameleon circuit in combination with the telepathic circuits. Since the TARDIS's reality quotient is slightly below 1.0 it effectively creates a low-level Perception Filter or Distraction Field that makes people passing by the TARDIS less likely notice anything odd about it by shifting attention away from it. This field is ineffective on people who are actively looking for something unusual or the object in question. The TARDIS uses this filter to reduce its impact on history.

If a TARDIS refuels by absorbing energy from a spatial-temporal rift it is likely that the ship's perception properties will be welded to that point in space by the rift. Anything placed on the patch of ground the TARDIS was parked on will become virtually invisible unless someone knows exactly what they are looking for. Portable high-level Perception Filters can be built using TARDIS keys.

### Atrium Circuits

The Atrium Circuits are an extension of a TARDIS's Chameleon Circuit. They allow the exterior shell to be shaped to create whole rooms which can be entered, but still leave the subject "outside" a TARDIS. As an added bonus they are capable of generating a powerful psychological defence around the Exo-Shell. Atrium Circuits were created sometime after the Type 53.

### Stealth Mode

Despite the Chameleon Circuit a TARDIS will still generate a field of tachyons that can tip off time aware races. And, while it is possible to hide a TARDIS from the observational powers of Gallifrey by placing it near a Naked Singularity, a Grey Immensity, a Phantom Star, or a Dwindler, some operators might wish to have a greater choice of locations. Stealth mode was developed as a way to hide TARDISes located in less exotic time zones.

When activated, Stealth Mode disables a TARDIS's connection with the Prime Eye of Harmony and deactivates all non-essential systems. Under normal circumstances it is easy for Gallifrey to get a signal lock on a TARDIS that has switched off all of its defence systems, however when running on only Emergency Power a TARDIS is virtually undetectable to everything, including Gallifreyan scanning devices. With the exception of basic life support, almost everything is made non-functional. As long as the discrepancy between the size of the exterior and interior is not too great, a TARDIS in Stealth Mode can pass as a normal everyday building. Even Time Lord visitors who materialize another TARDIS inside are unlikely to notice. A TARDIS can be switched from stealth mode to full power in as little as a few seconds, but this is very rough on the ship's systems and will cause many circuit overloads.

### Defence Force Field Prisms

The Defence Force Field Prisms are created by the Force Field Generator (see illustration) located in the console's stem. Without them the shock transferred from even minor collisions can cause serious damage to the Interior of the TARDIS. The can be operated manually but can also be set up to be triggered automatically by the HADS. When activated, these gravimetric shields surround a TARDIS and protect against almost any electro-magnetic radiation, physical, electrical discharge, sonic, magnetic, gravitic, psionic, and chronon forces. It can even deflect the blast from a starship's planetary bombardment missile. A TARDIS can withstand the destruction of a planet and the surface of a quasar or a neutron star. The heart of a star does produce enough heat to instantly vaporize the capsule. Any biological life that touches the Force Field will be repelled with a power electric shock. Attempts to paint a TARDIS with active force-fields will fail, as the paint will simply fall off. While the Force-Fields do not completely prevent the use of a TARDIS's communications systems, operators will sometimes find it necessary to deactivate them when sending complex telepathic messages. When operating in space there is a first and second line of defensive fields. The first is projected some distance away, the other is much closer to the exterior of the exo-shell.

The Force-Field Generator is found within the Stem of the Master Control Console. Even when the field has not been raised it is still operation, creating a very small force-field within and above it. Any small object that was to be placed there when the shields were 'raised' would become trapped in that area when the shields were dropped again. Operators should be aware Force Barriers are not standard equipment for Mark I TARDISes. The Force-Field system can be slaved to be activated by the HADS.

The Gravitic Anomaliser, shields a TARDIS from gravitic forces and can protect it from the gravity of a neutron star. In an emergency the Gravitic Anomaliser can be used as a dimensional stabilizer if the main stabilizer is fused.

The TARDIS Force Field in useThe default settings for the force field can be programmed to allow the Main Doors to be safely opened even when the TARDIS is in space. The main Force Field can also act to filter the air if the Main Doors are open. However these fields must be switched off for anyone to exit or enter the TARDIS. Since the Defence Fields for the Main Doors are on a separate circuit it is possible to enter or exit a TARDIS while all parts of the Exo-Shell (except the Doors) are protected. With some difficulty, the field for the doors can be extended beyond a TARDIS's Exo-Shell. This can be used to create a pressurized air shell or corridor with a range of about 10 meters. The force fields can also be reconfigured to generate null-gravity zones around the outside of the TARDIS. The Forcefield can be used to nudge the TARDIS from place to place. If the TARDIS is properly located, Force Fields can also be reprogrammed to serve as an energy field that will block sunlight over a very large area, replicating the effects of a solar eclipse. It can only manage this feat for a handful of seconds however.

The Force Fields cannot be penetrated by transmat beams unless the beam's power has been increased by a factor of 50 million beyond normal intensity. It would take a psionic force of tremendous (almost unbelievable) power to penetrate a TARDIS travelling the vortex. Beings such as the Guardians, Eternals, Sutekh, and higher life forms can penetrate a TARDIS's Force-Field Prisms by rotating the frequency of their attacks. Such an attack might cause the relative continuum stabilizer to fail, leading to a major power loss.

### Hostile Action Displacement System (HADS)

The Hostile Action Displacement System (HADS) can be found on all Type 38 and later TARDISes. If the HADS has been enabled by setting it in standby mode then the relocation device will automatically dematerialize a TARDIS if its Exo-Shell is threatened. Using the co-ordinate override, the relocation device will shift the TARDIS out
of "range" of the threat. Under normal circumstances it will travel forward in time up to one hour to escape before materializing in a random spot within one mile of its previous location.

As a four dimensional entity, a TARDIS is able to detect (and sometimes respond to) exterior dangers before the danger manifests itself. There are Warning Lights on the control console that indicate present or approaching danger. Some types of dangers can be detected from 20,000,000 light-years away. The system's settings sometimes need to be adjusted as it can be over-sensitive. It is not unknown for cannon balls or even a hailstorm to trigger the HADS. The Anti- Collision Device can trigger the HADS. The system can also be triggered if the capsule is in the presence of a being that is immortal due to being fixed in time in space. TARDISes with Autonomous Control have been known to automatically set the HADS in standby. The HADS has an Emergency Manual Override control, which can activate the relocation device. This is the easiest way for someone without a symbiotic nuclei to perform a micro-jump. As an alternative, the Defence Force Fields or Defence Indefinite Time-Loop Option can be slaved to the HADS to trigger instead.

Because this system will work even when a symbiotically linked Time Lord isn't on-board the HADS is often set when leaving a TARDIS unattended in a dangerous time zone. Certain violations of the 3rd Law of Time can stress the TARDIS's defence mechanisms, weakening the corporeal shell enough that it could be shattered by something a small as a sub-sonic cannon ball. The TARDIS will then have to abandon most of the broken shell and re-grow a new one from what's left. If possible, the TARDIS will use the HADS to retreat into the Vortex while this is done. However the operator doesn't need to be stranded during this time. The TARDIS will try to track down the artron signature of the last crew member to touch her exo-shell and materialize at their coordinates. In most cases the last crew member would be a Time Lord, however if the last crew member lacked a symbiotic nuclei then the TARDIS would be unable to lock on to and materialize at their coordinates. In such circumstances the recommended procedure is for the Time Lord to initiate close physical contact with the crew member being tracked. This will allow the TARDIS to detect the symbiotic nuclei and materialize nearby.

The operator should remember that if a regularly programmed space-time jump is initiated while the HADS's coordinate override is engaged the TARDIS will dematerialize only to rematerialize at the exact same co-ordinates a few seconds in the future. The HADS requires occasional servicing and will have a tendency to suffer minor failures if this is neglected.

### Defence Indefinite Time-Loop Option (DITO)

When activated by the operator (or the HADS), the Defence Indefinite Time-loop Option (DITO) continually shifts a TARDIS out of its current time cone and into the future (or the past), making it inaccessible. If the system has been pre-set the operator can also trigger the DITO using the TARDIS Key. Depending on the circumstances, the time shift can be from a picosecond all the way up to an entire millisecond. Setting the phase shift beyond this point is not recommended because shifting a TARDIS 1 second out of phase with the universe is very stressful for the TARDIS, causing severe gravity distortions, and the burning out of several systems.

The Time Barrier that DITO creates can be breached by constructing a Time-Bridge. Time Bridges can be constructed by dismantling and using the parts of a TARDIS.

If triggered by the HADS, the DITO will remain in operation until the threat has left the area. The Auto-Systems will then be used to return the TARDIS to its proper time cone, but if the shift is over a millisecond then the Auto-Systems will need a standing wave generated by a binary induction system to home in on.

### Main Doors (aka Dimensional Gateway, Real World Interface)

In accordance with the Doctrine of Non-intervention, TARDISes are designed not to affect history. Because of this crew members normally can't alter history unless they leave the TARDIS. The Main Doors serve as the primary entrance/exit of a TARDIS's interior Micro-Universe. They are found only in the Primary or Secondary Control room. The physical space-time bridge between the interior and the Exo-Shell is achieved with differential layer-slippage to create the minimum of user involvement in the mathematical sub-structure.

When set properly the main doors can be voice activated and deactivated by saying "Doors." There is also a mechanical lever (officially known as Number 4 Switch.) on the console that can be used to open the doors. A properly coded remote energy impulse can also be used to open the doors if sent from inside the control room. They can be set to automatically close if no one is in the Control Room. If all power has failed, the Main Doors can be opened using the Emergency Door Control which is a large hand crank inserted into the wall to the left of the doors. The default settings for the force field can be programmed to allow the Main Doors to be safely opened even when the TARDIS is in Space. However it is impossible to exit through the doors without first shutting off the force-fields that protect the main doors. With access to a subject's biodata, it is possible to create an exclusion field that will automatically prevent that specific person from entering the TARDIS.

Normally it is possible to see the exterior environment through the open doors, however when in airlock mode there is a spatio-temporal void known as the atrium zone between the inner doors and the exterior doors on the outer shell. The inner and outer doors can act as an airlock that functions in vacuum or even under water. The atrium zone between the inner and outer doors is usually a black void, but it can be rendered in curved mirrors or the standard roundel pattern. When rendered as a black void the exterior doors can not be seen from the control room even though they are less then 2 meters away. Likewise those standing outside the TARDIS will be unable to see into it.

The Main Doors' interior (and exterior) size can be altered by up to 50% using the architectural software. This is done with a localized mass inversion wave, which returns the doors to a raw energy state. The Doors can be programmed to be a maximum of about 15 feet tall.

An Emergency Door located in the Power Stacks Room leads out of the opposite side of the Exo-Shell from the Main Doors. This Emergency Door also functions as a more traditional airlock. (For other emergency exits see Fail-safe.)

Dematerializing while the Main Doors are still open can result in a gravitational distortion that tries to dump everyone out into the Vortex to be disintegrated by the Time Winds. If the Door were opened while a TARDIS was travelling in the Vortex an emergency system would initiate an Automatic Emergency Landing, but this system can be overridden. If the Force Fields have been activated first, then the doors can be open while in the Vortex - though only a white void will be seen. If the doors open during a Re-materialization the dimensional space pressure would compress the dimensional stability of the interior, drastically shrinking the TARDIS and its crew. Possibly even to the point of being able to explore molecules. This dimensional compression would reverse itself when the TARDIS next dematerialized. For these reasons failsafes keep the TARDIS lock from being taken apart during flight (though this can be bypassed by disconnecting the Time Rotor).

### Main Door Locking Mechanism

A TARDIS's Main Doors are protected by a double-curtain trimonic barrier, which is controlled by the Primary Threshold Systems. The lock is electronic and uses a meson projection and light refraction system to read the Trimonic Cypher-Indent Key to ensure that it has the correct crystalline molecular structure/code when compared to the lock's mathematical equation. If the code is correct, the Threshold Systems unlock the outer doors.

Another security measure is the "21 position lock." When it is enabled, the locking mechanism extends out of the shell and presents the user with 21 different key holes. If the wrong key hole is used, the whole mechanism fuses. Using the control console or properly programmed sonic screwdriver, the Main Doors can be Double-Locked (aka Deadlocked) from the inside. This prevents the Key from working in the lock. Double-Locking works even when the main and ancillary power is unavailable.

The TARDIS Lock can be jammed using a Laser Pencil tool (probably some type of Laser Cutter or a Laser Screwdriver). Goggles need to be used when operating the device at this power level. A jammed lock will have all of the combinations disabled so that no key will open it. If the lock has been jammed, then the operator can use his "stone with great power" (usually set into a piece of jewellery such as a ring or necklace) to refract light of a specific spectrum into the lock. This will open the door, but it is only a temporary fix and a Distrab from the TARDIS Tool Kit will be needed to field-strip and fully repair the locking mechanism. The entire locking mechanism can also be removed using the TARDIS Key. To remove or repair the TARDIS Locking Mechanism while in flight, the Time Rotor must be disconnected. This is necessary to override the fail-safes designed to prevent tampering with the lock while in the Vortex.

Normally a TARDIS's safety functions will not allow dematerialization while the Key is in the locking mechanism. But if the TARDIS is in Pause-Control, then inserting the key for more then 20 seconds will cancel Pause-Control and initiate dematerialization.

Type 53 and later TARDISES have Exterior Sensor Plates that the operator can be unlocked by holding the Key against the plate. Others used palm or retina scans. Some of the newer TARDISes built around the time of "Genesis of the Daleks" (Probably the Type 7-0-6) and those which have been upgraded have pure mind locks rather than key or touch activated ones. With this system the operator needs only to hold the key in his hand to lock or unlock the doors. This is usually accompanied by a chirping sound and a flash of the materialization beacon.[/tv[ Type 89 TARDISes (aka Type 102s) have locks with voice prints.

Attempts to pick the lock with primitive tools will result in an electric shock being delivered to the would-be intruder. Normally if someone tries to cut out the Lock, then a defence mechanism will destroy the saw blades in a flash of blue light. But operators should be aware, that if they divert all of a TARDIS's power to its drive systems it will be unable to activate is defence mechanisms. It would then be possible for intruders to breach the main doors. Under these circumstances and during other types of malfunction, the locking mechanism can be removed if someone has some simple electronic lock picking tools. With the entire exterior locking mechanism removed entry is impossible for the operator, even if they have the Cypher-Indent Key. For this reason, it is recommended that[/unoff[ the operator Double-Lock the doors when power is unavailable.

TARDIS keys are largely the same and it is fairly easy to use a key from one TARDIS to pick the lock of another TARDIS. This is because the total number of key/locks combinations available to TARDIS builders amounts to several dozen. With great difficulty, a TARDIS lock can be picked with a Sonic Screwdriver using the Devlin principle of randomized mathematical probability to generate the possible key combinations. A Tissue Compression Eliminator can also aid in neutralizing the locking mechanism. It is not unheard of for a TARDIS that has an exceptionally strong bond with its operator to be willing to open the door with a simple telepathic command. A being with incredibly strong psionic powers can force a TARDIS's Main Doors open from the outside. Such an attack would probably cause the Relative Continuum Stabilizer to fail. Powerful Rho Waves (of the sort used for hypnotic induction) have occasionally caused glitches making the ADM to double lock the doors.

### TARDIS key (aka Trimonic Cypher-Indent Key)

This key "unlocks" the double-curtain trimonic barrier that protects the Main Doors using its unique complex transdimensional crystalline molecular coding. The Key must be inserted into the Locking Mechanism to open the Dimensional Gateway. The key will vibrate when near the key-hole/sensor-plate.

The Key is isomorphic and uses beta waves to detect the metabolism, body pattern, and molecular structure of the person holding it to sees if it fits with a TARDIS's Approved Entrance File. This list can be updated and changed using the Control Console. The operator can desensitize a key to work for anyone by holding it against his head and sending the right telepathic command. If the Time Lord Operator dies, then the key becomes owner-neutral and will work for anyone.

If the operator desires, a secret compartment can created in the outer Shell of a TARDIS to hold a spare key. Duplicate Keys for all TARDISes can be found on Gallifrey, but it is possible, with difficulty, to construct a new key in a TARDIS Workshop. Duplicating a key takes about eight hours and the technician must ensure the new key is correct even down to atomic levels. The key can[/ttv] be constructed to replicate the appearance of any object or material. Once built, the Key can even morph its appearance into different shapes. Some versions have the Constellation of Kasterborus inscribed on the back.

If the DITO system has been pre-set the operator can use the TARDIS Key to trigger it. TARDIS keys are largely the same and it is possible to "pick" a TARDIS locking mechanism by modifying an incorrect Trimonic Key with small drops of telepathically programmed mercury.

Because the key is sensitized to its TARDIS it will glow and grow very hot when the TARDIS is about to materialize nearby. The TARDIS can signal the crew that an Architectural Reconfiguration has been completed by making the key glow.

It is possible to modify the key to track the location of its TARDIS if the ship is within 100 years of the key's location. A TARDIS key can even be used to track a missing crew members who have been processed by the PAST. A saline solution with a sample of crew member's blood must be prepared and then used to coat the key. The residual artron energy of the key will oxidise the blood. The key can then be suspended in a bottle of clear oil. Position of the key and the alignment of the oxidized blood particles can be used to calculate the rough direction and distance to the lost travelling companion.

A portable high-level Perception Filter can be built using a TARDIS Key, and parts from a laptop and a cell phone. However it won't work on all Time Lords.

### Early Warning System

Should a TARDIS be invaded by a hostile force, the Architectural Configuration Program can lock or unlock any door in a TARDIS interior from the console (there is a white flash around the frame when a door locks or unlocks). Pass keys for the locks consist of a series of mental images that the TARDIS reads telegraphically. An example might be: Crimson 11 delight "smell of dust after rain.' The Early Warning System can be configured to monitor a particular door or set of doors in the interior of the TARDIS. Should the doors be breached, alarm lights and buzzers will activate in the room the Time Lord is currently in.

### Internal Monitor

A Mark II TARDIS includes an Internal Monitor. This device detects the crystallization created by sapient biodata and thus allows someone in a control room to determine the number of sapient life forms inside a TARDIS. The exo-shell's Materialization Beacon can be set illuminate when there is one or more sapient being inside.

### Remote TARDIS Security System

This system is found on Type 45 and later TT Capsules and functions as a more primitive version of the SID. It provides extra security by means of electronic eyes at the Main Doors and an internal scanner. If the beams from the electronic eyes are broken, an alarm is triggered. The system is also equipped with several tanks of nerve and stun gas, which can be set to trigger remotely or automatically whenever the beams are broken. The Type 45 can also discharge a lethal energy burst, killing all humanoids who are standing nearby. The Remote Security System also can be tied in with the Internal Scanner and the main Scanner so that the interior and exterior of the TARDIS can be visually monitored.

The Remote Security System is often used in conjunction with the Portable Scanner. The Portable Scanner can be set to sound an alarm when the TARDIS is entered, and use the Internal Scanner to allow the operator to view the intruders. The operator can then remotely trigger the nerve or stun gas as desired.

### State of Temporal Grace Circuits (aka Internal Weapons Deactivation System)

The official name for this is the Internal Weapons Deactivation System, but many Time Lords refer to it by its nickname, the State of Temporal Grace. When activated, the system can instantly contain and prevent chemical, beam, nuclear, and psionic weapons from penetrating or being used in an aggressive manner inside a TARDIS. Depending on how you look at it, people within a TARDIS's Relative Dimensional Stabilizer field don't exist in the Normal Space anymore. It is this, and its link to the Telepathic Circuits, that allows Temporal Grace circuits to work. It can even prevent Stasers from functioning. The field is unable to affect the Master's Tissue Compression Eliminator because it works on the same principles as the dimensional stabilizers. A TARDIS can even flood its interior with Zero Particles to prevent antimatter reactions. But it should be noted that Zero Particles cause organic cell damage. More advanced Temporal Grace Circuits will even use the telepathic circuits to stop harsh or violent language.

Normally this system only works inside the Control Rooms, but it is possible to reconfigure the TARDIS so that the effect will temporarily extend throughout the TARDIS. Some TARDIS mechanics are capable of configuring the system so it won't effect a particular person but will still limit everyone else.

A TARDIS's Emergency Procedures automatically try to divert any large explosion or energy release into its Eye of Harmony. In an extreme emergency the Automatic Defence Mechanisms will set up a temporal bubble around the control room (trapping it in a time loop) to protect the crew. The Weapons Deactivation System requires frequent servicing and will have a tendency to suffer minor failures if this is neglected.

### Isomorphic Security System (Anti-Theft Protocols)

The Isomorphic Security System is part of the Anti-Theft Protocols. This program is a standard system in almost all Time Travel Capsules. If the Isomorphic Security System is activated, it will use a series of voice print and finger and palm print scanners to ensure that only authorized Time Lords can operate the Control Console. An optional part of this system allows parts (or all) of the console to be electrified using the Immobilizer Switch.

Even if an unauthorized user does manage to deactivate the Isomorphic Security System, the rest of the Anti-Theft Protocols will prevent the accurate piloting of the Capsule. It is difficult, but not impossible, to compensate for this system.

Many systems rely on Gallifreyan retinal scans to prime/activate them. There are several other Security Protocols, many of which can be customized by the operator. Security Protocol 712, for example, allows the ship to make an automatic flight to the coordinates outlined in an Authorized Control Disc.

### Limbo Atrophier

Standard equipment on all Type 65 and later TARDISes (including Type 102/89), this device ties in with the Telepathic Circuits and the State of Temporal Grace Circuits to 'paralyse' or 'freeze' any intruder whose bio-rhythms don't correspond to a pre-programmed list of 'friends.' The victim is trapped in a spare dimensional stasis field, which can only be deactivated from the Control Console. Depending on the setting, the intruder might be able to speak. This system can even be extended outside the Capsule to affect anyone who touches the exo-shell.

### Biological Barrage

When activated, the Barrage prevents all life form scanners from monitoring the location and movement of being inside the TARDIS. To ensure reliability, the Barrage is powered by the Ancillary Power Station.

### Pretend Self Destruct

All TARDISes can be set so that they will appear to be counting down to self-destruct. There is a 20-second timer.

### Time Torpedoes

Time Torpedoes are launched from the Time Warp Silos of a War TARDIS. It takes a little over 30 seconds for them to reach their target. When they detonate, their target is frozen in a microsecond of space-time. Depending on the setting this can last for months to several centuries. While these weapons are capable of breaching even a TARDIS's defences, any Time Lord or TARDIS that arrives in the blast area after the torpedo detonates will find itself to be unaffected by the temporal stasis field.

## Other TARDIS Systems

A TARDIS is a very complex machine, and has a whole host of systems that cannot be easily categorised. This section details such systems, from the TARDIS scanner to the Vespian Transmogrifier Ratchet Override Flangestimulator.

### Artron Mainframe

This is the Artronic computer network that handles all the systems aboard a TARDIS. The Artron Mainframe Module is located right beneath the Core Service Module and above the Transpower Systems. Because of its role as an interface between the four dimensional TARDIS and its three dimensional crew, the Relative Dimensional Stabilizers are essential for the TARDIS to understand the desires of its operator. Monitoring and controlling the RDS takes up more of the Artron Mainframe's processing power than any other function, leaving only 5% of that processing capacity for other functions. But that 5% represents a significant amount of computational power and the Mainframe also contains the interfaces for the Psionic (Telepathic) Circuits and is connected to the Navigation Systems, Guidance Systems, Drive Systems, Defence Systems, Life Support Systems, Self-repair Systems, and even the Emergency Transceiver. With a physical link to the Artron Mainframe, and the right Command Codes most functions of a TARDIS can be controlled.

With the exception of the Protyon Units, all of these systems are composed of exitonic (a.k.a. Artronic) Circuitry with Organic picotechnology elements. This circuitry is connected with fine grey, hair-like interfaces. Lights move up and down these hairs searching for faults. Older Artron Mainframes (like those on a Type 40) use Old High Gallifreyan for their programming code. Four modules stick out of the Artron Mainframe. These contain the data for the TARDIS Informational Systems. The Information-Banks, Data-Core, Data-Banks, and Memory-Store each have their own module.

While materialized a TARDIS will continual send a telepathic signal stating "TARDIS Mainframe – Waiting." While the Imprimature allows the Time Lord to detect the location of his TARDIS from several dozen meters away, most Time Lords can only clearly sense this standby message when they are inside the capsule. The Artron Mainframe is connected to the Matrix via the Telepathic Circuits, and if a Time Lord has the Key of Rassilon, he can physically interface their TARDIS into the Matrix's Thought Space.

Reliability is ensured by having the Fault Locator operate independently of the Mainframe. Security is ensured by requiring Command Codes to make major changes to the programming.The Mainframe has several firewalls, including one dedicated to protecting the TARDIS Sentient Matrix. Even with the Command Codes it would take over a year for the operator to disable all of the defences the Artron Mainframe has. However these defences can be vulnerable to hacking by code that involves a large amount of prime numbers.

It is, however, possible to overload the Artron Center Mainframe with brute force. Powerful Rho Waves (of the sort used for hypnotic induction) have occasionally caused glitches. And a signal powerful enough to pass sideways in time, from one universe to another, would be enough to overload any TARDIS that has its Scanner engaged. Such an overload would traumatize and disable the Artron Mainframe disabling power to almost all systems for almost 2 minutes while the system cuts back and contains the signal.

### TARDIS Relational Information Systems

These easy to access systems include the Information-Banks, Data-Core, Data-Banks, and Memory-Store. The Master Control Console contains an Informational Panel designed to provide access to this information. At least one roundel in each storage room or service tunnel can be opened to reveal an visual display unit and a keyboard which has access to the Information System.

Once booted up, all of the data can be retrieved via an Index File, which is displayed on a computer readout by typing "IF". Further data is recalled using key word searches. For more complex or lengthy operations a larger and easier to use data-bank keyboard can be extended out of a control panel using a switch located beneath the console. If one knows the right command codes a Space-Time Telegraph can be used to remotely access the Informational System. A TARDIS's computer interfaces are compatible with just about any system, including CD ROMs.

Information Systems are updated automatically by the Matrix when a TARDIS returns to Gallifrey. A TARDIS in the field usually receives regular updates for the Data-Banks from the Matrix on Gallifrey. The information in these transmitted updates are sent in waves that can even travel between universes (if the circumstances are right). But the owner of the TARDIS must pay a fee for the remote update service. Some operators (like the Doctor) save money by purchasing the abridged version (which suffers from several indexing inconsistencies).

All of the data in the Information Systems are stored in Memory Acids controlled by the memory management system. Memory Acids are adaptive, self-repairing, and semi-intelligent. Four modules stick out of the Artron Mainframe. These contain the Memory Acids for the TARDIS Information System. The Information-Banks, Data-Core, Data-Banks, and Memory-Store each have their own module.

#### Information-Banks

These contain the stellar maps and navigation data, which can be used by the operator in conjunction with the Astral Map to set the coordinates. The Information-Banks' Location Finder can be used to export coordinates to the Directional Unit. There is a large bank of flight computers that house the TARDIS Journey Logs. These logs automatically store data related to the TARDIS's navigation through the vortex. Each space-time jump is given a journey reference number for easy recall. Using the Fast Return Switch information can then be recalled and fed into the Directional Unit to return to a previously visited time zone. The autolog indicator light will be lit when a TARDIS is relying on this data Journey Logs. Journey Logs of the flight computer are near impossible to alter (i.e. forge a false entry) but are easy to wipe.

#### Data-Core

The Data-Core contains the TARDIS's technical specifications, and 18,348 Emergency Procedures. The Data-Core Query System provides access to the TARDIS Operator's Manual. However non-Time Lords will only have General Clearance, limiting which information they can accesses. For security purposes there are no flight instructions but it does have notes on the landing protocol.

#### Data-Banks

The Data-Banks contain encyclopedic information on important (from the Time Lords' point of view) planets, phenomenon, time zones, and people. It even has records of the fashions for various worlds. Entries include description of topic, a list of alternate nomenclature, derivation of name, space-time coordinates, and related entries. The Databank's historical records automatically update the tenses of its sentences based on the current time zone. After materialization, the TARDIS records all of a planet's radio signals and analyses the layout of any local cities. It also automatically records all audio and visual images presented on the Scanner screen. All of this information is filed in the Data-Bank.

#### Memory-Store

This storage space is designated for use by a TARDIS's crew. Using the Telepathic Circuits the Memory-Store can literally store memories that are downloaded into them. Memories stored by telepathic circuits can also be uploaded into the minds of a user. While this system is usually used by Gallifreyans for maintaining their own minds to prevent running out of storage space, the TARDIS is capable of wiping memories of severe trauma from someone. While the memories of such trauma can be removed, the subconscious damage will remain. If the field is set to high whilst a user is editing his memories, he runs the risk of accidentally copying and erasing the memories of any lesser species that is located within the TARDIS at the time. The Informational systems also store data from the Control Room Recorder, which can make video and audio recordings of anything in the Control Room.

### The Record of Rassilon

Every TARDIS built after the end of the Vampire Wars was equipped with the Record of Rassilon. This collection of magnetic cards contain the official history of the Great Vampire Wars. Inserting them into a slot on the console will produce a continuous scroll of paper with the information printed on it. It says (in part) that the Vampires are "the enemy of our people, and of all living things." It charges all Time Lords with the Directive of Rassilon: the task of destroying any Great Vampire or its descendants - even at the cost of his own life. The Record was withdrawn from all models of TARDIS after the Type 40.

### Interstitial Antenna (aka Communication Array)

This spire is located at the very top of the Time Sceptre and is part of the Control Sphere. It handles all Translevel Communications and sensor data collection while travelling in the Vortex. It receives sensor data for the Scanner, Absolute Tesseractulator, Mean Free Path Tracker, and Time Path Indicator. The Translevel Communications System incorporates all of a TARDIS's communications devices, such as the Telepathic Circuits, Voice Integrator, Telepathic Induction Circuits, Emergency Transceiver, audio units and internal communication systems. It is standard procedure for the Artron Mainframe to rout all messages into the interface in the Control Room for the operator to access. Using this system, a TARDIS can receive and translate almost any type of communications. The Translevel Communications System can tap into local communications networks (like phone systems) by using its scanners to map the electrical signals.

Using tracking equipment the TARDIS can even be programmed to follow these signals back to their approximate source. This can be done by first setting all the coordinates in the Space-Time Programmer to zero and using the tracking equipment to upload the new coordinates. Then an Emergency Materialization can be triggered to get a TARDIS to home in on and arrive near the source of a broadcast. This can even be done with the signal form a sonic screwdriver. Precise triangulation of a transmission's origin (down to a few inches) requires an independent second radial from a separate receiver. The TARDIS is also equipped with a box-shaped Wave Tracker that can be plugged into any receiver and the Control Console. Once this is done the TARDIS can generate space-time coordinates for the source of any signal detected by the receiver.

It should be noted that releasing large bursts of Artron Energy into the atmosphere of a G type world can cause atmospheric excitation and create instant snowfall.

### Space-Time Telegraph (aka Analogue Cross Time Telephone)

Just like more primitive telegraphs, Space-Time Telegraphs (sometimes known as Analogue Cross Time Telephones) can send messages to one another. If one splits a quark, the two resulting sub-particles behave as if they are in communication - even if they are separated by space and time. This is the key to trans-temporal communications and it can be used to allow one space-time telegraph to communicate with another one using t-mail. T-Mail (probably short for Telepathic Mail) consists of Artron signals that have been modulated into a syonic beam with spatio-temporal frequencies and extra-temperaneous wavelengths.

Because of the requirement of a quantum connection, the sender will require the receiving Time Lord's bio-data extract to send the signal. This extract is often stored within the transmitter's database. The Telepathic Circuits of another TARDIS can receive the syonic beam and the signal conversion unit controls that telepathic energy. A telepathic 'chime' tell the Time Lord that a message has arrived. After conversion, the t-mail can then be presented using the audio units, scanner screen, and/or the trans-temporal projector. Or the message can simply be projected into the operator's mind. When tied in with the TARDIS's central cortex and the voice integrator the telepathic circuits can even make all of a speaker's words come out backwards - at both ends of the communications.

Once the syonic beam has been received, the coordinates of the sender can be printed out on a strip of paper. If one knows the right command codes, a Space-Time Telegraph can be used to remotely access a TARDIS's Informational System. If the circumstances are right these waves can even travel between universes. But such a transmission would require the energy of a supernova.

Most Time Lords limit their use of T-mail due to the possible damage to the Web of Time that such transmissions might cause. For important information the Celestial Intervention Agency transmats Secure Delivery Capsules (SDCs) to their agents. But, when timeliness is more important then security, the CIA will send messages via t-mail. To ensure the existence of back up copies, top secret message are routed through the TARDIS closest to the receiver. These messages are encoded to prevent the relay TARDIS owner from reading them.

### Super Phone

A variation of the Space-Time Telegraph is a device that is sometimes known as a Super phone. With the right attachment, a radio communications transceiver (such as a cell phone) can be patched into the TARDIS's communications circuit, creating a "superphone." This gives the augmented cell phone universal (and transtemporal) roaming, with the ability to contact a network in another time zone that the TARDIS had previously visited. It can also send and receive text messages.

A TARDIS can also route cell phone signals through local satellite networks allowing it to interface with local networks in new Time Zones and transmit to any other broadcast based communications network in the area. Calls from the "superphone" can also be received by the TARDIS even if its in a different time zone then the caller, assuming the caller knows the number; for example, the number for the Doctor's Type 40 is 07700900461).

In an emergency, the superphone's link with the TARDIS can be modified so that it expands into a fully functional door into the TARDIS. While the capabilities of the Superphone are impressive, the superphone must remain within the same universe as the TARDIS to function. It should be noted that the Superphone's battery has a limited lifespan.

### Emergency Transceiver

The communications circuits of this system are used when the telepathic circuits are unsuitable or unavailable. The receiver module can be accessed for maintenance by opening a panel beneath the Master Control Console. The Transceiver gathers non-telepathic signals through the Receiver Grid. After materialization, the TARDIS records all of a planet's radio signals and stores this information, filing it in the Data-Bank. The sensitivity is such that it can pick up TV broadcasts from anywhere on the planet the TARDIS is currently located on. The Transceiver can be used to "hack" into wireless computer networks, satellite communications, cell phone networks and land-line systems by using its scanners to map the electrical signals. The communications circuits process and intelligently sift though these transmissions looking for specified data. Using the light-speed overdrive, the chronospatial antennae can broadcast wavelength based messages through thousands of light years of space. The Transceiver also allows a TARDIS to jam all but the strongest non-telepathic communication signals.

While primitive radio transmitters will be incapable of receiving external signals while inside a TARDIS's Force Field, it is possible to physically patch them into the communications circuits so that signals can be relayed (in both directions) through the Interstitial Antenna.

### Telepathic Induction Circuits

These circuits are located inside the Secondary Console, and are encased in a transparent cylinder that is 2.5 x 7.6 centimetres. Because the telepathic circuits are linked to the mind/brain interface of the operator, the Telepathic Induction Circuits are an essential part of the Symbiotic Relationship a Time Lord shares with their TARDIS. Through the Rassilon Imprimature a Time Lord becomes able to predict when materialization is imminent.While materialized, a TARDIS will continually send a telepathic signal stating "TARDIS Mainframe - Waiting." Most Time Lords can only clearly sense this standby message when they are inside the capsule. The link even allows the Time Lord to detect a badly wounded TARDIS's "cry" of pain. This exchange works both ways. This shared telepathic artron field greatly elevates a bonded Time Lord's artron energy levels. Removal of the Telepathic Circuits will sever the Time Lord's symbiotic link.

The circuits also play a vital part in the TARDIS' navigation. A TARDIS constantly generates a low-level telepathic field, which allows it to telempathically read the surface thoughts of its crew. This is done so that while travelling the Vortex the TARDIS draws on the intellect of its crew to increase operational efficiency. Some older ships have shown an affinity for the more primitive thought patterns of lesser species. If the operator is suffering from a mind altering drug (such as ginger beer), the telepathic circuits will pick up the irregular pattern formed in the interface. The space-time circuits will automatically copy this pattern and use it as an operating template to guide the TARDIS. This can cause numerous unpredictable and undesired effects.

A TARDIS generates a low intensity telepathic field of Artron Energy. The Imprimature allows the Time Lord to detect the location of his TARDIS from several dozen meters away. This telepathic field leaves a "thumb print" of the Time Lord's Symbiotic Nuclei and can be used by others to identify the operator of a TARDIS even after it departs. These prints get even more noticeable if a TARDIS makes a bunch of short hops. However this trail can be distorted by bypassing the Symbiotic Relationship Circuits.

The contra-inductor button allows the operator to broadcast an amplified telepathic message from the Time Lord's own mind to a specific target outside the capsule. The Signal Conversion Unit controls the telepathic energy that is received by a TARDIS's Telepathic Circuits. The Signal Conversion Unit can also lock on to, and jam, specific frequencies of psychic energy signals. Using tracking equipment the TARDIS can be programmed to follow the signals back to their source.

The Telepathic Circuits are capable of broadcasting a telepathic recall signal, which can be used by the operator to home in on the TARDIS. A Time Lord who is very close to their TARDIS can probably send a telepathic message which will cause its Eye of Harmony to detonate in a massive explosion that would destroy everything for miles. Using a telepathic amplifier and transmitter like the Core Circuits of a Telepathic Inhibitor a Time Lord with significant telepathic skills can transmit signals into the Vortex, taking complete control of their TARDIS from a distance. This probably causes the same long-term damage that early versions of TARDIS Remote Control caused.

The Telepathic Circuits are used to communicate with Gallifrey or other TARDISes via T-Mail. The circuits are also capable of receiving psionic beams from a Space-Time Telegraph. A telepathic 'chime' tells the Time Lord that a message has arrived.

The Vortex Shields can interfere with telepathic communications between people who are in the ship and people who are in Normal Space. But deactivation of the shields while in flight is not recommended. If an incoming signal is very faint, the operator can reducing the power to other TARDIS systems (including the lighting). The lack of interference makes it easier to decode a signal. Using the photon lever to channel more power into the telepathic circuits can boost reception, but this will quickly overload the console and cause a burn out.

Normally transmissions use rectilinear propagation within the normative space/time continuum, but it is possible to transmit messages to alternate realities by making the signal's wave front omnidirectional along every axis of the temporal continuum. It should be noted that this requires an external power source. Even a couple of minutes of transmission would use the energy equivalent to a supernova. The telepathic circuits can also receive messages from alternate universes that are sideways in time, but care should be taken, as such an energy signal would be enough to overload an unsuspecting TARDIS that has its scanner engaged. Such an overload would traumatize and disable the Artron Mainframe, disabling power to almost all systems for almost 2 minutes while the system cuts back and contains the signal. Powerful Rho Waves (of the sort used for hypnotic induction) have occasionally caused glitches

With the addition of the Thought Projector headset the Telepathic Induction Circuits allow a Time Lord to present his thought patterns and memories on the Scanner Screen. The Telepathic Circuits are capable of assisting crew members in dealing with mental invasions. Sometimes this takes the form of an avatar within the victim's mind. The circuits can destroy some types of parasites within a crew member's brain. It is even possible for a TARDIS to temporarily possess the bodies of people whose minds have been properly conditioned to receive their special signals.

Using a variation of Voice Integrator technology the TARDIS can manipulate the unconscious minds of the natives of the current time zone so that the Time Lord and his companions will be accepted by everyone they meet as being part of this world. This doesn't prevent the locals from perceiving the crew as a threat or an enemy. But it makes it very unlikely that anyone will believe that the crew is from completely outside their sociological system. This can cause undesired complications if the Time Lord should decide to tell the natives the truth.

Some have speculated that the Time Lords augment this field to the point where the Time Lord can subtly manipulate the thought process of lesser species, allowing him to seamlessly divert conversations and ideas into a more desired direction. While there is only inconclusive evidence for this type of sub-conscious manipulation, it is known that the telepathic circuits can perform a significant slight-of-mind alteration of the natives' physical perceptions of the crew. When modified in this way the locals will perceive the crew as being of their own species - even if the species is completely non-humanoid. It can even be fined tuned to present various racially based casts.

Untrained direct contact with the Telepathic Circuits links the user with a TARDIS's Artron Center, flooding his mind with memories and rendering an inexperienced user unconscious. If the TARDIS is properly configured then the Time Lord can serve as medium to transmit vast amounts of artron energy (though this will likely kill the Time Lord).

Using the Telepathic Circuits, the Memory-Store can literally store memories that are downloaded into them. Memories stored by telepathic circuits can also be uploaded into the minds of a user. The TARDIS is capable of wiping memories of severe trauma from someone, but the subconscious damage will still remain. If the field is set to high whilst a user is editing his memories, he runs the risk of accidentally copying and erasing the memories of any lesser species that is located within the TARDIS at the time. If exposed to theta emissions (say from a Dorganator) the telepathic circuits will fall in to a feedback loop, which can cause the minds of the TARDIS crew members to swap bodies. A Time Lord's knowledge of corporelectroscopy should make undoing this even relatively easy. If the operator suffers a serious mental trauma it can disable many of the TARDIS's systems including the telepathic circuits. Selkatonin can be used to repair overloaded telepathic circuits, however this substance is considered to be a restricted material by the Time Lords.

Under certain circumstances, the telepathic circuits can "catch" the mind of anyone who dies inside by entangling their time stream within time fields created by the Heart of the TARDIS. This can occur deliberately if the controls are properly pre-set, or if a TARDIS is positioned obliquely between two irrational time interfaces. This ability, with the addition of the healing Nanites from a TARDIS Sickbay, allows a TARDIS to bring those who die within a TARDIS back to life by healing their corpse and returning their minds to their bodies. In the case of being positioned obliquely between two irrational time interfaces the TARDIS can also reverse the ageing of a sentient, turning an adult into an infant. Such events will normally occur only if the TARDIS desires it, and for this reason, it is recommended that operators avoid irrational time interfaces.

### Microphone / Projection System

A TARDIS is equipped with an internal audio and projection system. The Audio Units are combination speaker/microphones that are found on the Control Consoles. A telescoping microphone can also extend out of the console on a flexible "goose-neck" arm. This microphone is primarily used for communicating with other "local" timeships within the Vortex. A TARDIS's loudspeaker system (otherwise known at the intercom) allows someone in a control room to broadcast their voice throughout all parts of a TARDIS's interior. These audio systems can be used in conjunction with the Scanner and other communications equipment such as the Voice Integrator.

The Control Room Recorder uses a sample image locator to make holographic, video, and audio recordings of anything in the Control Room.

The Control room has Trans-Temporal Projector that creates a hologram-like image with accompanying sound from the Audio Units. The Projector can be used for playing messages (such as T-Mail from Gallifrey) or displaying star charts across the ceiling. The holographic projector also displays a humanoid image for the medical bay's Automatic Diagnostic Terminal when in voice interface mode. The image presented is usually that of the operator Time Lord but, upon request, the TARDIS can use the memory store to find other avatars. The projector can be used to play pre-recorded messages if it receives the right signal or if an object containing a recognizable code is brought into the TARDIS.

A fully functional Scanner has an external speaker/microphone that is controlled by the Audio Units. It is possible to project a holographic image of the operator's face on the exterior of the TARDIS and the operator can also trigger a loud external klaxon.

### Voice Integrator (aka Psio-Linguistic Translator)

The TARDIS Voice Integrator telepathically conveys the "gift" of translation to the Time Lord, allowing him to understand any language. The Integrator was invented by a Time Lord named Therde. This Translation Unit can be found on the Type 32 and all later TT Capsules.

A red switch beneath the console controls the translation circuit. If the switch is reversed it will have a "Tower of Babel" effect making it impossible for anyone within the immediate area to communicate. For this reason some operators weld a plate over the switch to prevent tampering.

Right before materialization, a TARDIS will scan a planet's broadcast communications to gather data for translations. The Telepathic Circuits will determine the local language as soon as a TARDIS has materialized. New languages are stored in the Language Bank for future reference. If meaning and structure is detected by the telepathic circuits, then the Integrator will then provide a very sophisticated and very accurate two-way translation for the Time Lord. This is done by telepathically altering his brain so that he perceives the local language as being Gallifreyan. It will appear to the natives that the Time Lord can speak any language. The process picks up on most subtle nuances of conversation without trouble.

This Time Lord gift is shared automatically with any other sapient life-forms by the Passenger Adoption Scanning Terminal. In most cases, anyone who is on board the TARDIS when it dematerializes is screened and adopted by the system. Thus,[/ref] in theory, only the crew of the TARDIS will be able to experience the Voice Integrator.

While there is a limit to the distance at which the Voice Integrator can reach the TARDIS crew, its range is well beyond several light-years. The system can be re-configured to provide automatic translations for those that have not been processed by the PAST, but this is more likely to be noticed by the natives. And some TARDISes have been known to selectively 'adopt' certain acquaintances of the crew even if they haven't travelled in the TARDIS. The system can be retuned to become de-localized, providing the crew with the simultaneous communications of every being within translation range. In most cases this provides little more then an overwhelming babble of noise.

Once a crew member is adopted, the rho waves telepathically alter the subject's brain. If the subject is not familiar with Modern Gallifreyan, they will hear their own native language. The effect is so seamless that inexperienced members of the TARDIS crew often don't notice that they can suddenly speak and understand alien languages. Indeed, the integrator is usually configured so that lesser species won't notice its existence - even if it is translating for them. This illusion can be much more difficult to maintain if the subject remembers being unable to communicate with a specific species or culture before receiving the gift. This auto-conditioning can malfunction if the subject has been hypnotized or inebriated. Some people even have difficulty telling the difference between what they are thinking and what they are saying.

A fully functional Integrator will automatically alter the crew's names so that they sound normal to local aliens. It will also alter the crew's dialect to match whichever regional or cultural group they are currently speaking to at the moment. Conversely, the translated speech of local aliens is often given an additional accent in order to convey the alien's social class or educational level. The accuracy and appropriateness of these accents varies depending on the reliability of the TARDIS. Using the temporal grace circuits the translations circuits can also be set to filter swear words out of conversation (presumably by substituting less offensive words).

If a user is aware of how the Voice Integrator alters their mind, then they can, with significant concentration, bypass its effects and hear the language as it actually sounds (and see the text as it actually appears). While some Time Lords appear to be able to retain every language the integrator has ever given them most lesser species find that that their recall of previous languages (from earlier time zones) is minimal.

The Voice Integrator can translate any vocal language because the speaker has a mind that can be read, and the system can easily handle the scent-based communications used by many non-humanoid species. But the Integrator can't translate extremely primitive languages without assistance from the Animal-Language Translation Circuits. Normally the TARDIS selectively disables these circuits to prevent the crew from being overwhelmed by messages from passing non-sapients animals. Artificially constructed languages, like Esperanto, are often beyond the integrator's capabilities as are some extremely complex languages.

The Integrator's setting can be increased to translate written text if desired. But written text must already be stored in the Data-Banks in order to be translated. This limitation exists because text has no mind that can be read by the Telepathic Circuits. Due to an oversight in the programming, Gallifreyan is not always translated because it is assumed the TARDIS crew knows how to read it. Languages whose written form are very abbreviated or ideographic (such as Osiran Hieroglyphs) can cause the Integrator difficulties. By the end of the Time War, the only written languages not included in the Data-Banks are ones that have been described as "impossibly old."

It is possible (but unconfirmed) that the telepathic systems of the Integrator subtly manipulate the local inhabitants of a given time zone so that the TARDIS crew would be accepted by everyone they meet as being part of their own world. It should be noted that the locals might still see the crew as being dangerous or hostile but they will be perceived as being a known and understood part of that world. It will be very difficult for the crew to convince them that they originate from a point outside their sociological noosphere.

The telepathic circuits can be combined with the Voice Integrator to cause a person's words to come out backwards. Since the system is part of the Telepathic Circuits it can be disabled if all the symbiotically linked Time Lords are mentally incapacitated (such as post regeneration trauma). Under such circumstances, the Voice Integrator will not function until the Time Lord has recovered.

### Printer

This printer is built into the Console. When used it extrudes a ticker tape that is about 5 centimetres wide. It automatically prints the data stored on any Magnetic Card inserted into the Console. A large scale printer capable of producing bundled newspaper is located in one of the console room's roundels.

### Scanner

The Scanner and Sub-Scanners consists of a collection of thousands of instruments designed to gather information about the environment outside a TARDIS. Chief among these is the visual signal, which is displayed on the Scanner Screen found in any of the Control Rooms. In most cases the image translator can enhance the available light so that even in darkness a colour image can be produced. If the capsule is surrounded by total darkness the scanner can be switched to infra-red or a traditional searchlight can be activated. The visual signal has a maximum magnification of 200 power. It can even be pre-set to visually locate specific items, but the operator should be aware that the Visual Orientation Circuits can be confused by heavy fog. The Scanner can also be refocused with some difficulty, to show the interior of various rooms within the TARDIS. A TARDIS memory bank automatically records audio and visual images presented on the Scanner.

Other sensors built into the Scanner (but on a separate circuit from the visual signal) include audio circuits (to relay sound), a gravity dilation meter, seismic sensor, warp oscilloscope, movement detectors, magnetic field sensors, magnetic compass, metal detectors, radiation detectors, transmat beam detectors, absence detectors, a hyperspatial-mass sensor, thermal search circuit, infra-red sensors, low-light sensors, terrain mappers, and an altimeter. The radiation detectors can be adjusted to measure the radiation count for an entire planet. There is a space radar that can detect ships in orbit of the current planet. Active Sensors use detector beams and have a range of about 100 miles.

When some types of 5-dimensional Scanning Modes are enabled, the Time Rotor will rotate within the Column, presenting the operator with and approximation of the ship's current space-time coordinates. The passive Time-Line Flux Adjuster detects some types of temporal anomalies and has a range of about 60 million light-years (though it must be told what to look for and where to search).

The TARDIS Scanner is keyed to its operator's brain pattern and can track his biodata movements over at least a mile or two. Some operators have preprogrammed a switch that will instantly display the location of their symbiotically linked Time Lord. The Scanner can also be reconfigured to focus on other psionic resonances.

It is standard operating procedure to check the display dials for oxygen, atmospheric pressure, temperature, and radiation before leaving the ship. The Atmosphere Monitoring Subsystem's Atmosphere Analysers can help identify a G-Type environment (aka Gallifrey-like) and is hooked to a dial that will indicate if the air quality will be fatal to humanoids after a few hours of exposure. There is a display light on the console that warns the crew if the outside environment is dangerous. The TARDIS has a Seismic Scanner that predicts local volcanic stability over short periods of time. The materialization indicator light will continue to flash and and buzz if the capsule has arrived on a moving vessel. Some of the sensors trigger alarms that alert the crew, such as if a TARDIS is shifted into Warp Drive, or when the doors are opened and the exterior environment is extremely hostile. Some forms of danger can be detected up to 20,000,000 light years away.

The Scanner's Image Translator (see picture), located in the Master Control Console, interprets the absolute positive value of the coordinates to create the visual image. The scanner has an interstitial beam synthesizer that is essential to its operation. Data collected by the Scanner (especially the visual signal) is usually displayed in 3D on the full-colour Scanner Screen, which is usually located on the wall of the Control Room. Most screens offer full colour but some are only capable of black and white. Different types of scans can be made to appear on the scanner depending on which band the operator selects. Band 6 is good for observing neutron stars. The scanner can collect data from aerial scans and use it to update pre-existing maps in the data banks. It can even create symbolic displays to represent 4-dimensional phenomenon such as time loops. This screen can also be used to display data from the Control Console. Images and data presented on the Scanner Screen can be manipulated with a light pen. Many versions of the Scanner Screen have shutters that close when the scanner has been deactivated.

There are other, less popular, ways to view information from the Scanner. An entire wall of the Control Room can be converted into a massive screen. A Trans-Temporal Projector can create a hologram-like image with accompanying sound that allows the operator and the console to appear (from the operator's point of view) to be surrounded by the outside environment.

Shortly after de-materialization and right before re-materialization the Scanner Screen can show an image of the appropriate planet. If the Scanner is used while travelling in the Space-Time Vortex, a 3D representation of the Vortex Wormhole will appear on the screen. A red tint is often used for travelling forwards in time and a blue tint usually indicates travel into the relative past. Many people find seeing all of reality spinning by to be a disturbing experience. For this reason the scanner screen is often deactivated during vortex travel.

If the Scanner hasn't been used in a long time the image will be vague and hazy as the system warms up. Strong exterior magnetic fields can interfere with the Scanner by disrupting the flow of Artron Energy. If a TARDIS is transported into Exo-Space (E-Space) it will require a local Image Translator to properly interpret the new negative coordinates. Without it the Scanner will only show positive coordinate images from Normal Space (N-Space). The Scanner is calibrated according to continuous constant time. If there is no flow of time outside a TARDIS then the Scanner Screen will show only gibberish. If the TARDIS is severely damaged the self-repair circuits might require so much power that the Scanner will not operate. Any faults in the interstitial beam synthesiser which prevent the scanner's operation. Some parts of the Scanner Mechanism, such as circuit board K17, can only be replaced by leaving the TARDIS and accessing the scanner from outside the ship.

### Portable Scanner

This pocket watch-sized device links in with the TARDIS Scanner allowing the Time Lord to activate and control his TARDIS's Scanner while in the field. Since the Scanner can also be re-focused to scan inside the TT Capsule the Portable Scanner is also allows the Time Lord to monitor the interior of his TARDIS while not on board. Due to the density of the data transmission the transmission range is only 10 kilometres

### Surveillance System

The Surveillance System was developed after the Mark IX TARDIS. This system allows a TARDIS to continually collect and store all data observed by its sensors. This data was then uploaded to the Matrix. Using the Matrix's processing abilities this data could be used to render visual and audio images for events occurring anywhere within its collection field (at least several miles) even if the event in question was deep underground. Despite not becoming available till after the Mark IX Refit, this function was retroactively installed in all capsules running earlier refits by Gallifreyan technicians at the first available opportunity.

### Temporal Instability Detector

This device is found on Type 45 and later TARDISes. It can detect any other TARDIS (that aren't in Stealth Mode) at a range of up to 800 kilometres.

### Time Scanner

Using the Metastasis Switch, a TARDIS Scanner can also be set to serve as a Time Scanner. This will allow it to view the possible future or past of current time zone. Unfortunately when configured as a Time Scanner the system will occasionally pick up completely unrelated data from any point in space and time. It is for this reason that the Time Scanner isn't considered very reliable. 

### Poly-Directrix Lenses

Poly-Directrix Lenses are found on Type 45 and more advanced TARDISes. By controlling the Dynanometer Needles the operator can direct the lenses to spy on the interior of a 'nearby' TARDIS. It should be noted that these lenses only provide visual data, not audio.

### Fabrication Dispenser

The Fabrication Dispenser is found on Mark III and later master control consoles. A fully functional TARDIS can manufacture any substance in practically unlimited quantities including gold (but probably not mercury or Zyton-7). It can even create any type of currency or complex devices such as a sonic screwdriver. It should be noted that some Gallifreyan technology is made of non-atomic matter and thus can't be fabricated with this system.

The fabrication process takes a lot of time and requires large amounts of energy. While Temporal Orbits can be used to fold time allowing any object or objects to be constructed instantaneously (from the viewpoint of anyone outside the TARDIS) this was considered to be a (minor) violation of the Laws of Time. This restriction was lifted during the Time War.

### Time Safe

This small safe can be programmed to send objects back in time to appear in the safe at an earlier point. A Time Safe is described as a permitted paradox under the Laws of Time. The Safe allows an operator to warn himself about an upcoming situation, but it also removes much of the operator's free will to deal with the situation.

### Hover Mode

The outer shell has variable mass, and this combined with a modification of the Defence Force Field Prisms allows a TARDIS to hover or float. Using short bursts of power, a TARDIS is capable of generating kinetic movement. While in hover mode the console will generate a humming noise. Putting the TARDIS in Hover Mode makes it easier to use the Manual Override controls to navigate.

A TARDIS can be set to fly in space. If no one is at the controls a TARDIS will automatically lock on to the nearest gravitational source and travel to its surface. It is possible to manoeuvre in a zero gravity environment and put a TARDIS into a spin. The acceleration is at least 9.8 meters per second squared (allowing it to hover on a G-Type world) or travel through space. It can compensate for 28 kilometre per hour winds and reach speeds of at least 100 kilometres per hour. Its maximum speed in a Type G atmosphere is about 50% faster then most 21st century cars (so about 300 kilometres per hour). With great difficulty, an operator can use a TARDIS to parallel or pursue a moving ground vehicle. It is even possible to clumsily dodge intervening obstacles.

A TARDIS can be put in a Parking Orbit above a planet before materializing on its surface. It is also equipped with Vworp Drive for long distance travel through real space. In this mode it can escape from the gravitational field of a black hole at distances that even vessels of the year 2500 AD can't escape from. Caution should be taken, as the response time of the inertial dampener will be sluggish if Vworp Drive hasn't been used recently.

### Environment Governor

A TARDIS has a stabilizing effect on the local area (~100 miles) of the Multiverse. The Environment Governor uses the Dimensional Stabilizers, Probability Compensators, and (on occasion) even the TARDIS's own exo-shell to fix or patch some kinds of space-time anomalies.

If any object's Time-State changes or its Reality Quotient gets too low, then a TARDIS will "catch" the object and put it in the Catch-All Area. The object (or person) will remain there for up to half an hour before a TARDIS returns the object to its original coordinates. To protect a TARDIS from infiltration, the Catch-All Area is completely cut off from the rest of a TARDIS and barricaded by the Force Field Prisms.

Using the Governor the TARDIS can seal cracks in Time that lead to Parallel Universes, repair damage to the time lines, and act as temporal de-crystallizers The Governor can also deal with time eddies, time-ships, and temporal feedback. In an extreme emergency, the TARDIS's exoshell can even be used to plug some types of holes in space-time.

### Time Lock (aka Temporal Lock)

A Time Lock can be used to prevent a time traveller (with a lower reality quotient) from affecting a time zone or object. Any time an event is observed by a sentient being (whether biological or artificial) that event becomes crystallized in history. The higher the observer's reality quotient, the more crystallized or fixed in history the event becomes. A TARDIS normally has a reality quotient of slightly less then one to reduce its impact in any time zone. However a TARDIS's reality quotient can be boosted so that it can place a Time Lock field on a nearby object to fix it in time. An object (even another TARDIS) under a strong Time Lock is very difficult to dematerialize into the Vortex. It also becomes very hard for any timeship to enter a zone that has been Time Locked. This boost is limited to a reality quotient of 3 for a Type 40. Thus a Type 40 could trap another Type 40 but a later model TARDIS would be able to escape, sending the Type 40 spinning off into the Vortex.

### Chameleon Arch

The Chameleon Arch is a piece of technology that can be deployed from the ceiling of the Control Room. With this device, a Time Lord can disguise themselves as whoever or whatever they want to be, allowing a researcher to infiltrate primitive societies without any danger of interfering with the Web of Time.

A single being can have its biological nature instantly changed by altering his morphic field. Using electrical charges and a Gallifreyan's regenerative powers, the Chameleon Arch rewrites the user's genetic structure, biology, and biodata, changing every single cell in the subject's body. If necessary, his two hearts will be compressed into one. The process is extremely painful.

Morphic fields are created by the crystallization of history through observation by a conscious mind. The shape and nature of every lifeform in the universe is influenced by the morphic field of that species. The Artron Energy created by a living being creates the morphic field as a sort of collective psionic aura which acts as a species equivalent to an individual's biodata. The longer a particular species has been around the stronger its morphic field. These fields build up over several generations (probably as a side effect of the crystallization of history caused by observation). It is the manipulation of morphic fields that also allows the conceptual based mutations caused by a Cell Mutator and the Chameleon Arch.

It is worth noting that, unlike normal regeneration, the newly generated personality can be completely different to the Gallifreyan's original personality. The subject's original biodata (history and biology) is stored in a Gallifreyan biodata module that appears to be a pocket watch. The shape of a pocket watch is used because it is a symbol of the Time Lords' mastery of Time. It should also be noted that the module does emit a powerful psychic aura which can be detected by even untrained telepaths. If the watch is opened near the subject the subject will painlessly revert to their original biodata and memories. The user will, however, retain all the memories he had while in his alternate form.

Because morphic field manipulation requires a living organic mind capable of adapting to the irrational changes caused by the alterations, the process is connected to the physiological information in the databanks and controlled by the TARDIS's Protyon Core. The Chameleon Arch can be set for different species (including human). It can even make an adult user into a child. Depending on the setting the Arch will insert a back-story into the subject's mind The TARDIS can be programmed to select a local where the subject's new biology and back story will fit right in.

### Sonic Booster

The Sonic Booster fills most of the space in the Master Control Console's pedestal and is connected to the base of the time rotor's pedestal with high amperage cables. The Booster is controlled by the Tremulator Switches. The two Temulator Switches control the transmission of sonic vibrations to the area outside the TARDIS. They can be used to cancel dangerous vibrations, such as local earthquakes, tidal waves, and hurricanes. In an emergency the Sonic Booster can be modified into a omnidirectional sonic weapon.

The sonic booster might also be used to aid in a Gallifreyan's regeneration in a process similar to Lazarus's Genetic Manipulation Device, which used resonances from hypersonic waves to destabilize the user's cells for regeneration.

### Gravity Tractor Beam

The Tractor Beam works by turning the polarity of the TARDIS's Vortex Drive to generate a field of negative energy that takes the form of an anti-gravity spiral. This field is capable of countering the effects of a black hole at short range. The tractor beam can exert enormous amounts of gravitational energy in 5 second bursts. It is even capable of towing planets around. Operation of the system on full power puts a severe strain on the capsule. When shifting planetary or stellar bodies it requires a full crew of six to prevent serious distortion of a TARDIS's interior spatial dimensions.

Using the dials beneath the dematerialization array the operator can use the secondary attachment to link to the energy signature of an object in space. If that object has likewise had its energy signature locked on to the TARDIS's engines the TARDIS can pull the object through the Vortex and drop it elsewhere in space and time.

## Storage Rooms

A TARDIS isn't just a vehicle for travelling in space and time. As a TARDIS has no real constraints on the amount of space it can use, most TARDISes contain extensive areas which can be used as living quarters or storage space.

### Pedestrian Infrastructure

The Pedestrian Infrastructure makes up the habitable interior of a TARDIS's internal quasi-dimensional continuum. The Infrastructure is composed of a complex web of bio-mathematics and exitonics with a finite multidimensional mass, which usually totals about 68 thousand metric tonnes. Every TARDIS comes with a default tangential formation which determines the location and floor plan of its power and storage rooms. This formation is always organized according to a specific geometry, which can be followed if you understand the pattern.

All TARDIS have a core known as a Time Sceptre. This central structure is made up of the Control Room Sphere, Core Service Module, Artron Mainframe, Transpower System, and the Eye of Harmony Sphere. Each segment is an independent micro universe whose size depends upon the requirements of the systems it contains.

The tower of the Time Sceptre is enclosed in a spherical chamber that is several miles in diameter. This chamber (or endo-shell) marks the limits of the quasi-dimensional continuum that is the TARDIS's micro-universe. This spherical chamber is covered with numerous pods connected by rods. These are the extra store rooms and corridors.

The operator can exert direct control of the interior architecture, and some operators choose to alter this tangential formation, designing things as they see fit. Despite the fact that all the rooms are physically organized into a Time Sceptre and pods on the outer chamber, dimensional junctures (aka space-time bridges) allow the operator to effectively lay out the pedestrian infrastructure as he sees fit.

The Power and Storage Rooms of a TARDIS are accessed (using dimensional junctures) via service tunnels (aka corridors), galleries, walkways, stairways, escalators, and lifts. Using Dimensional Junctures the rooms don't even have to be connected in any logical or mappable fashion. Multiple doorways can lead to the same room, and a single doorway can lead to two different places depending on which way you walk through it. Some frown on these sorts of configurations and believe that a properly stabilized Pedestrian Infrastructure should be able to be easily mapped in three dimensions. Temporal Locks are another way to customize the architecture. They can be used to separate part of the TARDIS interior, such as a Storage Room. Temporal Locks can even be used to connect that room to Normal Space via a Real World Interface. Once set up, a Temporal Locks is activated or deactivated by pressing the three green light-up buttons found inside the room in question.

The interior of the Pedestrian Infrastructure appears to be fairly standardized for even the most eccentric TARDIS and operator, such that any Time Lord will be able to find their way around with minimum difficulty. A fully functional TARDIS will guide lost crew members to their destination using glowing arrows on the walls. For a variety of reasons the interior layout of a TARDIS often changes slightly over time. For more information see Architectural Configuration Program . By the end of the Time War some Time Lords will have upgraded their TARDIS architecture to make sure the room they need comes to them.

Junction in the TARDIS corridorsUsing Dimensional Junctures the interior is organized by level, sector, tunnel, and room number. Corridors (aka service tunnels) are classified by a colour and a number code (e.g. Blue Section 2-5). Rooms are catalogued with a number and a letter (e.g., 23A, 23B). The letter might indicate which level the room is on. There are at least 12 levels which can be reached with stairs, escalators, or lifts. The Lift Shafts have ladders mounted on them. The interior of the shaft sometimes looks identical to the corridors only vertical. Rooms are classified as either Power Rooms or Store Rooms. A TARDIS has a total of fifteen Power Rooms that contain all of the machinery that powers and operates the ship. They are located deep in a TARDIS's interior and serve as the "nerve centre" of the capsule. The following power rooms are known: The Cloister Room, Power Stacks Room, Dynamorphic Power Station, Ancillary Power Station, Protyon Unit, Life Support Systems, Internal Scanner Room, Fault Locator Room, the Primary Control Room, the Secondary Control Room, The Tertiary Control Room. There are also several Control Relay Rooms which look like smaller versions of the Secondary Control Room.

Aside from these 15 power rooms and the 3 Control Rooms, all rooms are classified as Store Rooms, and these make up the bulk of the Pedestrian Infrastructure. A Standard TARDIS includes bedrooms, bathrooms, maintenance bays, and research labs. With the exception of the Basic Crew Facilities, all storerooms are located in pods around the outer surface of the spherical micro-universe A standard TARDIS has a million Store Rooms and at least 12 levels. On average there is a room for every 3 meters of corridor or service tunnel. The total volume of rooms and corridors in a complete Type 40 TARDIS has been described as being about the size of a small town. It's also been described at being at least twice the size of San Francisco's Chinatown at the beginning of the 21st century. This means that the volume of the Pedestrian Infrastructure is between 13,000,000 and 60,000,000 cubic meters. A fully guided tour of a Type 40 TARDIS could take a couple of years. Regardless of how the lifts and stairs are configured, as one gets closer to the Cloister Room, he will feel as if he is descending deeper and deeper into the TARDIS. This is because the Cloister Room is located at the bottom of the Time Sceptre.

Matter used to create the rooms and service tunnels is created using Block-Transfer Mathematics and has enhanced temporal properties. This also makes it resistant to being retro-annulled and immune to the normal Vortex energies. During the Time War the matter used for the internal structure of a TARDIS was capable of withstanding a full-on thermonuclear blast. Aside from the Zero Room (which is balanced to zero energy), all rooms show up on the Architectural Configuration Indicators.

The default colour for this matter is off-white; however individual rooms (and perhaps the entire interior) can be redecorated quite easily by changing the Desktop Theme. Coral (see illustration) and Leopard Skin are just two of the many options. Once the setting is changed it appears to take several months for the TARDIS to redecorate a room. During this time the TARDIS will place a sign on the door to that room that says "Closed for refurbishment".

Most walls are decorated in glowing roundels that have their own power source. Behind some roundels are medical kits, storage lockers, emergency controls, and circuitry access. Aside from the glowing roundels there are no obvious light sources in a TARDIS – nevertheless the interior will be quite well lit. This is due to Visual Stabilizer Circuits, which are capable of generating and controlling photons anywhere in the TARDIS. The interior lights can be controlled from a switch on the console or by voice commands. Normally the interior of a TARDIS is quite sterile and its atmosphere is automatically-cleaned. Rooms in the TARDIS have air vents. Some have four-bladed transparent ceiling fans to move the air. Using this Architectural Configuration Program, the operator can lock or unlock any door in a TARDIS interior from the console (there is a white flash around the frame when a door locks or unlocks).

### Control Sphere

Located at the top of the Time Sceptre, the Control Room Sphere contains the following:

- Interstitial Antenna
- Control Rooms
- Switch Room

### Core Service Module (CSM)

The Core Service Module (CSM) is a sphere located beneath the Control Sphere and above the Artron Mainframe. It holds most of the Power Rooms, the Dynamorphic Generators (and other travel systems), life support systems, and basic crew facilities. The last includes bedrooms, bathrooms, maintenance bays, and research labs.

The CSM sphere is surrounded by a grid of matter control projectors. Using these Matter Control Projectors the Dimensional Stabilizers maintain the CSM. They also control all the custom designed add-on modules, which are then linked (via space-time bridges) to the CSM.
The CSM contains the following rooms:

- The Ancillary Power Station
- Power Stacks Room
- Protyon Units
- Internal Scanner
- Dynamorphic Generators
- Life Support
- Basic Crew Facilities
    - Living Quarters
    - Sleeping Quarters
    - Rest Room
    - Bath Room
    - Wardrobe

### Living Quarters

These rooms are assigned to a TARDIS crew as needed. As Gallifreyans require almost no sleep, there are no beds in the Living Quarters. The Living Quarters do have holographic TVs. The Auto-Diary option allows crew members to record entries by speaking in an empty room.

The Chancellor's Suite (a type of VIP Suite) can be found by exiting the Secondary Control Room, turning left, travelling up 3 stages, down 1 stage, taking the next 3 lefts. Its door is marked "No Entry."

### Sleeping Quarters

These rooms contain beds for crew members to use. The gallifreyan beds fold up into the wall when not in use. The beds are rectangular, but can be remotely adjusted to flex at any point. About one third of the Sleeping Quarters are large "Master Bedrooms", the rest are regular size. The large sleeping quarters have their own bathrooms. There are at least 18 of the large rooms. A TARDIS has an optional diurnal (day/night) cycle. The duration of these cycles, if enabled, will be derived from the brainwaves of the authorized crew members. The lights are controlled by voice commands. The Laundromat's laundry circuits automatically repair, clean, and iron any clothes left overnight in the sleeping quarters.

### Food Dispenser Room (aka Rest Room)

This room serves as a recreational lounge for crew members while in flight. It has couches, books, tables, games and contains the Food Machine. This machine dispenses traditional Gallifreyan food (i.e. tablets, pills, wafers, and white bars) on paper plates. Liquids are produced in self-sealing bags, plastic bulbs, or wax paper cups. All beverages except water appear as a light orange liquid. The Food Machine can produce alcohol. If given a small sample the Food Machine is capable of replicating the flavour and texture of any type of food, but the appearance and colour is limited to standard preprogrammed designs. A TARDIS will ensure that all life-forms travelling with it will get food and water. If necessary the Food Machine will use its wheels to roam around the interior of a TARDIS looking for people who are hungry. The TARDIS has devices that will alter the metabolism of its travellers so they won't gain too much weight if they overeat.

The capacity of the Food Machine is immense, able to last hundreds of years without the need for restocking. Even then, given time, a TARDIS can use block transfer to restock its food supplies. It has been described as holding 4 bazillion recipes.

While there is a small kitchen annex attached to the Rest Room most operators prefer the large kitchen with stasis preserver refrigerators that can keep food fresh forever. This refrigerator uses the TARDIS Fabricator to restock itself. In a Type 40 TARDIS this kitchen usually ends up being located very far from the Control Room.

### Bath Room

Bath Rooms contain Gallifreyan organic waste handling systems. The sink and holographic mirror fold up into a wall roundel. The taps dispense water at the precise rate and temperature desired. Bath Rooms have Zero-G Jacuzzis and anti-gravity Ultrashowers, which spray high-pressure water and muscle oil to both clean and massage the user. The Bath Rooms are also equipped with Autorazors. This small device crawls around the user's head and in less then 5 minutes can shave a humanoid face, provide excellent customized haircuts, and style and set a crew member's hair.

Bath Room Number 14 contains a large swimming pool. This room has a separate gravity control and super-buoyant bath water so drowning is almost impossible. The Emergency Bathroom can be found by leaving the control room and taking the third door to the right.

### Wardrobe

A TARDIS carries records of the fashions for various worlds. The standard TARDIS wardrobe is equipped with samples of these fashions. This multilevel room contains a vast amount of clothes, which are organized alphabetically by planet and period. The Laundromat's laundry circuits automatically repair, clean, and iron any clothes left overnight. A spiral staircase provides access to different levels. In a Type 40, the Wardrobe could be reached from the Primary Control Room by taking the first left, second right, third left. Continue straight ahead beneath the stairs, and take the fifth door on the left.

### Sickbay (aka Medical Bay)

The Sickbay has been part of every TARDIS's inventory since the Type 21. In a Type 40 TARDIS it can be found by leaving the control room, going up the stairs and taking the next two lefts. It contains the Advanced Diagnostic Terminal (ADT). This device consists of overhead medical scanners for studying the patient, extensive data files on advanced medical techniques, and three separate computers to ensure reliability. It is capable of providing excellent medical advice and instruction for almost any type or infirmity for Gallifreyans and Time Lords. The ADT can be programmed by a qualified medical expert to provide service for other races. The holographic projector can display a humanoid image for the medical bay's Advanced Diagnostic Terminal when configured for voice interface mode. The image presented is usually that of the operator Time Lord but, upon request, the TARDIS can use the memory store to find other avatars. This avatar can appear in the Control Room as well as the Sickbay.

The beneficial environment of the TARDIS can help in prevent wounded people from passing out. Gallifreyan Medical Science has devices that can heal skin wounds a few inches across in under half an hour. Bruises and cuts from a major brawl can be healed in 15 minutes. Minor skin damage can be fixed in seconds. Though the Zero Room can heal many types of wounds, the Sick Bay contains a Surgery room with an operating theatre Within this theatre is a blue Surgical Containment Web for life threatening injuries. Once the patient is placed inside the Web the lasers cut away any damaged flesh and remove any foreign objects or implants. Organic polymers are then used to replace missing flesh, while granites enable the reconstruction of body tissue. Fingernails can be re-grown easily. And severed limbs can be reattached. Whilst the polymers can re-grow missing limbs in Gallifreyans, they can not re-grow lost hands or limbs on humans because their technology isn't advanced enough. This is one of the few medical problems Gallifreyan science hasn't solved yet.

The TARDIS contains instruments for measuring Artron irradiation (useful for verifying if the subject has travelled through the Vortex). The Sick Bay is also equipped with a Quarantine Bay and the Cell Regeneration Vault. The Cell Regeneration Vault is a coffin-like cabinet that uses a low-power matter transmitter with a discriminating filter at either end to absorb
almost all types of radiation from its patient (including Icaron Radiation). The treatment causes the subject to feel a burning sensation. It can take days to heal a severally irradiated person. The Cell Regeneration Vault is found on Type 66 and later TARDISes.

### Sleep Room

This Room is often used to treat medical conditions that prevent restful sleep. It is equipped with a bed and a Neural Dampener that induces sleep. Multi-level Pacifiers can be used to sedate even a Time Lord. On setting 8 the Dampener prevents the subject from dreaming.

### Utility Room

This room is usually located near the Living Quarters and stores a variety of personal equipment including a First Aid Cabinet and a TARDIS Tool Kit.A TARDIS Tool Box recharges and runs diagnostics on its tools. For security purposes the box can be set to open only for the correct operator.

### TARDIS Tool Kit

A complete Tool Box includes the following:

- Sonic Screwdriver
- Sonic Monkey-Wrench
- Emergency Log (with millions of hours of recording time)
- Master and Moog Drone Clamps (for stabilizing TARDIS architecture)
- Stalos Gyro
- TARDIS Homing Beacons (which track the telepathic traces)
- Influx Booster Stabilizer
- Laser Cutter
- Magnetic Clamp
- Chronometer (which reads out correct local time no matter where the operator is)
- Neutron Ram
- Pen Torch
- Stabilizing Devices
- Astro-Rectifier
- Multi-Quantiscope (some models have extra heads for removing Mergin Nuts)
- Ganymede Driver (also useful for removing Mergin Nuts)
- Demeter Uncoupler (for 2 gauge and smaller nuts)
- spare Mergin Nuts
- Zeus Plugs
- Winklegruber Crimps
- Finkle Groober
- Crystal Transreverser
- Neutron Grips
- Electron Crank (or the newer Ion Grapple)

### Workshop

This workshop is fully equipped to construct and repair many types of devices. It can even be used to construct extra-dimensional cubes (i.e. dimensionally transcendental) of any size, and dimensional pockets. However, because of their size, the cubes can interfere with a TARDIS's dimensional stability. The seventh Door on the right of the corridor outside the Console Room holds the Workshop. The Workshop is usually found three levels below the Ancillary Power Station.

### Infinity Chamber

The Infinity Chamber is a room that can project a pan-dimensional hologram of a galaxy or the entire Universe at any point in its history. The Chamber on a TARDIS is limited in resolution to picking up the orbits of planets. The complex neural net that makes a segment of a TARDIS's Fuzzy Logic Circuitry (aka Intuition Circuit) is connected to this chamber. This neural net is capable of locating time rifts and (by comparing recorded data to information collected by the Scanner, can detect major changes to history. A smaller relay console can be found here that allows the operator to pilot the TARDIS.

### Dimensional Induction Chamber

This vast dimensional viewing room uses trans-temporal projection to show the environment outside the TARDIS.

### TARDIS Laboratory

This room is the size of a school assembly hall. It has computers, charts, shelves of books, and four large workbenches. Attached to the Laboratory is a lead lined room filled with samples of radioactive isotopes. Among the numerous devices in the lab is a psycho-telemeter, which can use a sample to trace the origin of an object, a particle accelerator, oscilloscopes, lasers, electron microscopes, a holographic magnifier, a dimensional revisualiser, advanced DNA testing equipment, and a scanner "capable of identifying life-forms smaller than a single proton."

### Artron Mainframe

This module holds data banks, diagnostics, and self repair systems. It contains the following systems:

- Artron Mainframe
- TARDIS Information Systems
- Fault Locator Room
- Molecular Stabilizers
- TARDIS Library
- TARDIS Manual Room

### Library

A TARDIS has at least two libraries, each a different size. The TARDIS libraries are sorted by planet, with each room getting its own planet. Within each of these rooms the books are sorted by subject, then planetary region, then year, then quarter years. The larger Library takes up dozens of rooms, and each of these rooms has two shelves, which are a couple of miles long and tall. A brass ladder or spiral staircase provides access to the upper levels.

Most of the "books" are stored in trionic lattice data cubes that are kept in book-shaped cases, but some of the books are capable of reading themselves out loud. A TARDIS uses the Telepathic Circuits and the Architectural Configuration Program to help the crew find the data they are looking for.

### TARDIS Manual Room

This smaller library contains the thousands of manuals (including this one) required to cover every aspect and detail of a TARDIS's operation. They are organized into 72 volumes.Among the many books are the TARDIS Manual, the TARDIS Handbook Type ##, the Type ## TARDIS Handbook, the 726 page long TARDIS-Service Manual, the TARDIS Type ## Master Control Console Operating and Repair Manual (which some operators keep in the control room), the TARDIS Instruction Manual, numerous volumes of House and TARDIS, and the TARDIS Technical Index.

Most of the information is these books are given in 6th dimensional mathematical symbology. The Service Manual is probably a "read-this first" guide. House and TARDIS is a magazine that is bigger on the inside then on the out. Inside one can find a near infinite amount of loose-leaf advertisements. A TARDIS manual can also be accessed from the control console by pressing a button marked "Manual."

### Transpower System

Energy from the Eye of Harmony travels through the Transpower System to be distributed to all the TARDIS's Power Rooms. Regardless of how the lifts and stairs are configured, as one gets closer to the Cloister Room, he will feel as if he is descending deeper and deep into the TARDIS. This is because the Cloister Room is located at the bottom of the Time Sceptre.

- Transpower System
- Zero Room
- Protyon Units
- Cloister Room

### Zero Room

All TARDISes from the Type 28 onwards have a Zero Room. The insulated walls of the Zero Room completely cut it off from the outside universe. It is, in fact, a pocket universe within a TARDIS's Micro-Universe. The Zero room entrance is located on the lower levels, near the heart of the TARDIS. The room smells like roses and has a calming effect on all life forms. Even gravity is local and can be subconsciously controlled, allowing anyone to levitate comfortably.

Inside the Zero Room healing granites with regenerative cells can heal many types of wounds including deafness from having one's ears boxed. However the healing only begins once the patient has fallen asleep. Skin wounds can be repaired in a matter of minutes and most other physical wounds can be healed in few hours if the subject can remain alive long enough. The regenerative cells use chemicals to heal burns and the granites can neutralize many types of poison. If an emergency is expected a TARDIS can be flooded with healing granites, which will begin providing aid instantly. In such a case the granites would work with the Temporal Grace Circuits.

Zero Rooms are also used by Gallifeyans to recover from difficult regenerations. A TARDIS can also supply Artron Energy to help an ailing Time Lord. Zero cabinets can act as stasis chambers for Time Lords.

Zero Rooms probably use bio-electronics. A properly sealed Zero Room uses strong force interaction to fuse the internal interfaces together. This gives it better invulnerability then the exterior of a TARDIS and make it immune to Tissue Compression Eliminators. It should be noted that Zero Rooms are balanced to zero energy, and thus don't appear on the Architectural Configuration Indicators. It takes several months for a TARDIS to produce a new Zero Room if the original one is lost.

### Eye of Harmony Containment Sphere

Located at the bottom of the Time Sceptre, this module has the receptor antenna to collect energy (either from Gallifrey or a rift) and store it in the Heart of the TARDIS

### Other Store Rooms

The tower of the Time Sceptre is enclosed in a spherical chamber that is several miles in diameter. This chamber (or endo-shell) marks the limits of the quasi-dimensional continuum that is the TARDIS's micro-universe. This spherical chamber is covered with numerous pods connected by rods. These are the extra rooms and corridors. New customized modules (rooms) are added when needed using a Protyon Unit's matter generation technology. This allows the operator to generate a new custom designed module on the outer sphere, which is then linked (via space-time bridges) to the Core Service Module.

There is a Sports Center which contains the space and equipment necessary to take part in every type of Gallifreyan sport. Other rooms found inside a TARDIS include an Art Gallery, Conservatory, a cinema, a Studio, Central Nexus Point, a vehicle garage, a water purification plant, a wine cellar, attics, and boot cupboards (see illustration).

The TARDIS can artificially simulate almost any undeveloped planetary surface with massive storage rooms. The Artificial Jungle, for example, includes crumbling stone temples and pools of goldfish. They can have their own weather systems, and some are big enough to contain several climbable mountains. Other examples include a rose garden, an artificial forest, multiple arboretums, and a room filled with butterflies. The doors to these artificial outdoors are hidden in such a way that, when closed, it can be very difficult to find them again.

### Armoury

Some operators have equipped their TARDIS with an armoury This grey room is filled with metal racks holding almost every conceivable hand held weapon.

### Storage Holds

Undefined Storage Holds make up most of a TARDIS's interior volume. Each Hold has an identifying number.

### Memory Storage Area

Any Block-Transfer object made by the Protyon Unit is manifested as a "real" object. Those objects that are not in use are put in the Memory Storage Area. This vast room is filled with off-white, non-functional, copies of every object stored in a TARDIS's Data-Core.

### Shell Room

Every time the Chameleon Circuit creates a new exo-shell to disguise the TARDIS a duplicate of the shell is stored in the Shell Room. A TARDIS that has done lots of travelling will have vast numbers of shells stored in the shell room. It should be noted that even if the Chameleon Circuit suffers a complete system breakdown (as many older TARDISes were prone to do if they didn't receive regular chameleon conversions) the Shell Room will continue to collect new unused shells every time the TARDIS materializes.

### Catch-All Area

The Environment Governor of a TARDIS has a stabilizing effect on the local area (~100 miles) of the Multiverse. If any object's Time-State changes or its Reality Quotient gets too low, then a TARDIS will "catch" the object and put it in the Catch-All Area. This is a cream coloured room in a TARDIS interior, which has a fountain. The object (or person) will remain there for up to half an hour before a TARDIS returns the object to its original Spatial and Temporal Coordinates. To protect a TARDIS from infiltration, the Catch-All Area is completely cut off from the rest of a TARDIS and barricaded by the Force Field Prisms.

### Minus Room

The TARDIS auto-systems will automatically create a Minus Room if the interior dimensions of the ship are threatened by time. A Minus Room uses a lens of unreality to distort reality and deflect time away.

## Types of Time Travel Capsules

TARDIS technology didn't come into being fully formed. Different components came into being at different points, and the technology has developed considerably over the millennia. This section documents the differences between various Types.
