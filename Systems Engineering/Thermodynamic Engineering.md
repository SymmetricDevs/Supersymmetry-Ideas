In order to achieve a both realistic and enjoyable gameplay experience of thermodynamics, we must make amends.
The goal with this module is to provide an implementation of components that generate, utilise and transfer thermodynamic inertia (also known as temperature or heat/cold). 
Certain processes require a specific temperature to operate, while others generate inertia as undesired byproduct that has to be removed to ensure function of that unit. 
# Sources of positive TI
- Electric Heater
	As simple as it gets: uses high-resistance wires^[Os, W, C, Si, GE] in a tightly wound coil to transform electricity into heat. 
- Combustion Heater
	Comes in several varieties; Solid-fuelled, particulate, gaseous, liquid. 
	Burns carbon-rich fossil fuels and chemicals to generate latent heat. 
- Solar Concentration
	Varying set-ups enable the concentration of sunbeams on (a) central point(s), through which a working medium is heated. Requires vast amounts of space and materials to be economical. 
- Nuclear Fission/Fusion
	Accelerated decay and fission of radionuclides generates tremendous heat, but requires complex management and chemical infrastructure (dependent on reactor construction). 
# Sources of negative TI
- Evaporative cooling
	Typically component of a refrigeration system, this method evaporates (boils) a low boiling point working fluid to absorb latent heat, cooling that surface/component down. 
- Chemical reactions
	Certain reactions are net-negative on their energy required, but this is unlikely to be feasible on grand scale.
