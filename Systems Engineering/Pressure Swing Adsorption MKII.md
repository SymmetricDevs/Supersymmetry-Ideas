Pressure swing absorbers act by funneling a gas-borne mixture (usually air) into two (or more) reaction vessels fitted with molecular *sieve*. Suzy’s PSA currently resembles a single reaction column, which does not represent the ”real deal”. 
So hypothetically, to implement it in Susy, it’d take high-pressure air and produce either O2/N2 (dependent on sieve) and return less HP air, and then would require a cooldown. This’d facilitate needing two or more columns to produce a constant stream of O2/N2. Additional [[Control Systems]] would facilitate their coordination. 

At the moment it also is troublesome to balance the consumption of both equally. For reference, i am using the O2 to oxygenate my gas turbine, which only uses a trickle, and use the N2 for LV superconductors, which uses way more. Without using the machine-internal void fluid mode (which would make it run constantly) i will clog up on either eventually. 

Additionally, i’d want to recommend using the PSA to separate biogas from CO/CO2/SOx/NoX etc. for pure or purer and higher-grade methane (CH4). 
Nat-gas PSA is planned as far as i’m concerned. 
It appears that PSA can also possibly separate ethanol-water azeotropes, likely in vapor form.
