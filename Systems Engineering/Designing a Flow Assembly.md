Referring to [[Flaws of GT5u and Related]]; GT5u and *MANY* games suffer from didactic reduction which reduces complex procedures and chains into a (mostly) linear sequence of “A+B->Y+Z”.

In reality, many chemical and pyrometallurgical processes operate in a continuous manner where x is added to a pool and (at certain conditions) y is removed. 
Ex.: An atmospheric distillery column has a constant input flow/feedstock and its respective fractions are removed/piped out of this system at a constant rate.
Nearly every process of [[Beneficiation]] can also be treated as flow processing. 

Batch processes are utilised, but by no means as common (where a specific charge/load of a system is processed and then dumped).
