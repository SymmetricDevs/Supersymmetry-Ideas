Hello everyone!
In the general process and whatnot of working on the pack, we've noticed that two aspects of the pack are currently lacking in a way that we, the devs, can't fix:
- Screenshots on the main Menu 
- Structures, Set pieces and Decoration in-world
And by such, we've come to ask you, yes! you! to submit *your* content and have it voted upon.
Rules of common sense apply (strange that I have to say that but you never know with this community), so no stupid stuff. Developers and Staff will moderate at their discretion.

Regarding Main Menu Screenshots: You are encouraged but not required to use shaders. We want to show how SUSY plays out and not make it look better or worse than it is. 
## TL;DR:
SUBMIT YOUR BUILDINGS / SCREENSHOTS
	(In #screenshots with the according tag at the moment)
HAVE THEM VOTED UPON
GET THEM INTO THE PACK
PROFIT (WITH FAME AND BLING)

## Regarding Structures
### Classification
#### 1. Set piece
Does not contain any notable loot, only the structure itself
	- Example: rock outcrop of ores or like the current concrete spires, wooden shack, etc.
#### 2. Zero-Threat 
- A site that should be able to be conquered with pre-LV equipment, but has some challenge.
	- Example: abandoned mine, falling/gravel hazard, but some tools etc. 
#### 3. Low Threat
- Scalable with LV-MV equipment, according loot. 
	- Example: Bandit Camp like we have it right now but less ugly
#### 4. Medium Threat
- Same as above, MV-HV gear.
	- Example: Military training camp 
#### 5. High Threat 
- HV-EV gear. 
	- Example: The current structure with AE loot. 
	- Example 2: Fortified camp featuring landing pads. 
#### 6. Great Threat
- EV+ Gear
	- Example: Scape & Run: Parasite-overrun area with abandoned buildings and such. 
	- Probably better ignored and barricaded away for long times. 
### Footnote
I also know y'all want AE2 desperately, but please. Have *some* consideration. AE Loot should be High Threat+ loot. 
The size of a structure can and should be directly related to their Threat Level.
