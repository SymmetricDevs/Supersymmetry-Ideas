## Lore:
It was built to move small group of passengers (typically small tactical strike teams) into orbit around either the Earth or the Moon.
This means the ship itself is small and has little cargo capacity.
After the war (which is 98 years before the start of the game) they are used by descendants of military members that managed to survive, typically a family unit will control one of these launch pads, they often enter into conflicts with each other. These are rarely destructive enough to damage the infrastructure. However the much more fragile rockets are lost at a far larger rate. Few families still have a working ship and even fewer have passed down the knowledge to properly maintain it.
The reason why these ones are more likely to still be intact is that being smaller they are easier for small groups to use and maintain, the large passenger and cargo launch systems are long lost (and will be found rarely as other more ruined and rarer structures).
