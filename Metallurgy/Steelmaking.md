# [[Ferrous Metallurgy]]
Contemporary steel mills can produce up to 40â€™000 metric tons of pig iron per hour. 
The implementation of this chain would require three individual and new multis:
- Regenerative Heat Exchanger (known as Cowper)
- Refined Blast Furnace (bigger counterpart of the PBF designed for [[Designing a Flow Assembly|Continuous Recipe Logic]])
- Oxygen Furnace (Generalised Oxygen Converter)
